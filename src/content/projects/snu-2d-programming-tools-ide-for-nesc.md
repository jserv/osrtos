## Overview

The SNU 2D Programming Tools IDE for nesC is a specialized development environment submodule designed for the nesC programming language. As part of the broader SNU Programming Tools ecosystem, this project focuses on providing the necessary tooling and interface for developers working with nesC, a component-based, event-driven language used primarily for building applications on the TinyOS platform.

## The Role of nesC and TinyOS

nesC (Network Embedded Systems C) is an extension to the C programming language designed to embody the structuring concepts and execution model of TinyOS. TinyOS is a popular open-source operating system designed for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in sensor networks, ubiquitous computing, and smart buildings. 

This IDE submodule facilitates the development of nesC applications by providing a structured environment for managing `.nc` files, which define the components and interfaces that make up a TinyOS application. By integrating with the SNU 2D environment, it aims to streamline the workflow for embedded developers targeting resource-constrained hardware.

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured as a web-compliant IDE, utilizing HTML5 frameworks for its interface. This allows for a portable development environment that can be accessed via standard web browsers. Key technical aspects include:

- **nesC Integration**: Support for the `.nc` file format and nesC-specific project structures.
- **Build System**: Utilizes a Makefile-based system (`makefile.mk`) to manage compilation and project tasks.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reflects the nesC philosophy of building software from reusable, wired components.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to run in environments respecting WHATWG web standards.

## Project Philosophy and Standards

A significant portion of the project's documentation is dedicated to its commitment to software freedom. The project is explicitly DRM-free (Digital Restrictions Management), following the guidelines of the Free Software Foundation and Richard M. Stallman. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL3), ensuring that the tools remain open and accessible to the community.

## Getting Started

To use the IDE, users typically require an HTML5-compliant browser and the necessary nesC/TinyOS toolchains installed on their local system. The project includes an `INSTALL` guide that outlines the requirements for viewing and using the IDE, including support for various image formats (SVG, PNG, JPG) and Markdown for documentation. Developers can contribute to the project by following the extensive guidelines provided in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, which covers professional conduct, snapshot creation for versioning, and performance efficiency.
