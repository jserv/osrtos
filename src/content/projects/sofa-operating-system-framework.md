title: Sofa Operating System Framework
summary: Sofa is an operating system framework built on the seL4 microkernel, providing
  a suite of userland servers and a POSIX-compliant API via the musl C library. It
  includes a virtual file system, a UDP network stack using lwIP and virtio, and comprehensive
  process management capabilities.

Sofa is a sophisticated userland environment and operating system framework designed to run atop the seL4 microkernel. By leveraging the security and performance of seL4, Sofa provides the necessary abstractions and services to transform a bare microkernel into a functional operating system environment. It implements a set of core servers and a high-level API that allows developers to manage processes, threads, and system resources with ease.

## System Architecture and Features

At its core, Sofa utilizes an Inter-Process Communication (IPC) model between the root server, known as the `kernel_task`, and various user applications. This architecture follows the classic microkernel philosophy where system services are isolated into separate components. 

Key system features include:
- **Process and Thread Management**: Support for threads within processes, including lifecycle management through a dedicated Process service (Enum, Spawn, Kill).
- **Networking Stack**: A UDP stack integrated with virtio-net-pci devices, utilizing lwIP for network protocol handling.
- **Storage and Filesystem**: A Virtual File System (VFS) supporting mount, open, read, and close operations. It currently includes a virtio-pci-blk driver for block storage access.
- **Device Support**: VESA support for graphics and a DeviceKit for hardware abstraction.
- **Name Server**: A service registration and discovery mechanism that allows components to find each other by name.

## POSIX Compliance and musl

One of the primary goals of the Sofa project is to provide a familiar environment for developers. By incorporating the `musl` C library, Sofa aims for high levels of POSIX compliance. This allows for the porting of standard C applications with minimal friction. However, the project explicitly avoids the implementation of `fork`, citing modern research into the limitations and complexities of the fork model in microkernel environments. Instead, it focuses on a robust `spawn` and thread-based model for concurrency.

## Application Ecosystem

Sofa comes with a set of essential applications that demonstrate its capabilities and provide a base for further development:
- **init**: The initial userland process that orchestrates system startup.
- **shell**: A command-line interface for interacting with the system.
- **udpecho**: A sample server used to test the network stack and virtio integration.

## Development and Simulation

The project is designed for x86_64 architectures and provides comprehensive tooling for simulation via QEMU. The build system is based on CMake and Ninja, integrating tightly with the seL4 build environment. Developers can test the networking stack directly from a host machine using tools like `nc` (netcat) to communicate with the UDP echo server running inside the simulated Sofa environment.

To facilitate deployment, Sofa includes scripts for creating ext2 distribution images and qcow2 virtual disks, making it easier to manage the system root and bootable media. The project serves as an excellent reference for developers looking to build complex system services on top of the seL4 microkernel.
