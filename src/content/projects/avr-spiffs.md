title: AVR SPIFFS
summary: A specialized port of the SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) for AVR microcontrollers,
  specifically targeting the Arduino Mega 2560. It enables wear-leveled file system
  support on external SPI flash chips with a small footprint of 30KB ROM and 512 bytes
  of RAM.

Integrating a reliable file system into resource-constrained microcontrollers can be a challenge, especially when dealing with external SPI flash memory. The **avr_spiffs** project addresses this by providing a streamlined port of the SPIFFS (SPI Flash File System) specifically for the AVR architecture, with a focus on the Arduino Mega 2560.

### Overview and Resource Requirements
SPIFFS is designed for SPI flash devices on embedded targets, offering wear leveling and file system consistency. This specific implementation is highly optimized for the AVR platform. To run this library, your system needs approximately **30KB of ROM** and as little as **512 bytes of RAM**, making it a viable solution for the Mega 2560's ATmega2560 chip.

### Hardware Support and Connectivity
The project has been verified to work with the **BY25Q64AS** (8MB SPI Flash) and similar chips. Connecting the flash chip to an Arduino Mega 2560 follows a standard SPI wiring scheme:

| Signal | Arduino Mega 2560 | BY25Q64 (SOP-8) | Other (SOP-16) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CS** | GPIO 11 | Pin 1 | Pin 7 |
| **MISO** | GPIO 50 | Pin 2 (DO) | Pin 8 (DO) |
| **MOSI** | GPIO 51 | Pin 5 (DI) | Pin 15 (DI) |
| **SCK** | GPIO 52 | Pin 6 | Pin 16 |
| **GND** | GND | Pin 4 | Pin 10 |
| **VCC** | VCC | Pin 8 | Pin 4 |

### Implementation Example
The library provides a straightforward API for initializing the system, mounting the partition, and performing standard file operations like opening, reading, and writing. Below is a basic example of how to initialize the file system and write a simple string to a file:

```c
#include "src/spiffs_api.h"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  
  // Initialize SPIFFS with Chip Select on pin 11
  sys_spiffs_init(11);
  
  // Mount the file system
  sys_spiffs_mount();

  char WriteBuf[] = {"hello world!"};
  spiffs_file fd;

  // Create and open a file for writing
  fd = SPIFFS_open(&fs, "my_file", SPIFFS_CREAT | SPIFFS_TRUNC | SPIFFS_RDWR, 0);
  
  // Write data to the file
  SPIFFS_write(&fs, fd, WriteBuf, sizeof(WriteBuf));
  
  // Close the file descriptor
  SPIFFS_close(&fs, fd);
  
  Serial.println("File written successfully!");
}

void loop() {
  // Application logic
}
```

### Key Features
- **Wear Leveling**: Extends the life of your SPI flash by distributing write operations across the memory array.
- **Small Footprint**: Tailored to fit within the constraints of AVR-based Arduinos.
- **Standard API**: Uses the familiar SPIFFS API, making it easier for developers who have used SPIFFS on other platforms like ESP8266 or ESP32 to transition their code.
- **Integrated API Layer**: Includes `spiffs_api.h` to bridge the core SPIFFS logic with the AVR SPI hardware peripherals.

This project is an excellent choice for Arduino developers needing persistent data storage, logging capabilities, or configuration file management on hardware that lacks a native high-level file system.
