Learning embedded systems often requires stripping away the abstractions of modern operating systems to understand what is happening at the register level. The **Embedded Systems Bare Metal Programming Ground Up** project is a comprehensive repository of exercises and implementations designed to do exactly that. Based on the popular Udemy course by the same name, this project serves as a practical guide for developers looking to master the STM32F407G-DISC1 discovery kit using the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

### Hardware and Environment
The project is specifically tailored for the **STM32F407G-DISC1** discovery board, which features an ARM Cortex-M4 core. To manage the build process and debugging, the project utilizes **Segger Embedded Studio**, providing a professional-grade environment for bare-metal development. Each module in the repository includes the necessary startup files, memory maps, and register definitions required to get the hardware running from scratch.

### Key Peripheral Implementations
The repository is organized into several distinct modules, each focusing on a specific peripheral or low-level concept:

*   **GPIO and BSRR**: Beyond simple bit-masking, the project explores the use of the Bit Set/Reset Register (BSRR) for atomic pin manipulation, which is a critical skill for writing efficient and thread-safe driver code.
*   **UART Communication**: Includes implementations for both Transmit (TX) and Receive (RX). It covers the initialization of the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter, baud rate calculation, and data handling.
*   **Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)**: Features dedicated libraries for configuring the ADC, allowing the microcontroller to interface with the analog world. The code demonstrates how to set up channels and trigger conversions.
*   **General Purpose Timers (GP Timer)**: Timers are the heartbeat of embedded systems. This module covers the configuration of internal timers for precise delays and periodic events.

### Technical Approach
Rather than relying on high-level HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) libraries that hide the underlying complexity, this project uses **CMSIS**. This approach provides a thin abstraction layer over the hardware registers, ensuring that the developer remains in control of every clock cycle and bit transition. 

For example, the UART implementation involves direct manipulation of the `USART_TypeDef` structure provided by CMSIS, ensuring that the developer understands the relationship between the reference manual and the actual C code. The project also includes custom libraries for peripherals like the ADC, showcasing how to structure reusable code in a bare-metal environment.

### Getting Started
To use these examples, you will need Segger Embedded Studio and an STM32F407 Discovery board. Each folder (e.g., `ADC`, `UART_TX_RX`, `GP Timer`) contains a `.emProject` file. Opening this file in Segger Embedded Studio allows you to build and flash the code directly to the target hardware. The inclusion of `SEGGER_THUMB_Startup.s` ensures that the vector table and stack pointers are correctly initialized before jumping to the `main()` function.

This repository is an excellent resource for students and engineers who want to move beyond "Arduino-style" programming and gain a deep, fundamental understanding of how ARM-based microcontrollers operate at the hardware level.
