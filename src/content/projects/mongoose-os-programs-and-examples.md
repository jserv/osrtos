## Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of programs and configuration templates for Mongoose OS, an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) firmware development framework. The project focuses on leveraging the capabilities of ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers to build connected devices with a strong emphasis on cloud integration and remote management.

## Key Components and Features

The repository contains several specialized directories and configuration files that highlight the versatility of Mongoose OS:

- **Cloud Integration**: Extensive support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) IoT Core is evident through configuration scripts that automate the setup of MQTT bridges, SNTP synchronization, and device registry management. 
- **RPC Framework**: The inclusion of `rpc_singleNode_control_inbuiltServer` demonstrates the use of Mongoose OS's Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism, allowing for remote control and monitoring of device states over various transports like WebSocket or MQTT.
- **Hardware Interfacing**: A dedicated `esp32_pin_map.cpp` file provides a clear mapping for ESP32 GPIOs, including definitions for SPI interfaces and multiple sensor connections (S0-S3, TC1-TC3), suggesting use cases in complex data acquisition systems.
- **Connectivity Management**: The project includes a `wifi-setup-web-master` component, which typically provides a captive portal or web interface for end-users to configure network credentials without hardcoding them into the firmware.
- **Scripting Support**: References to `mjs` in the configuration files indicate the use of the embedded JavaScript engine, allowing for rapid prototyping and logic implementation without full C/C++ recompilation.

## Technical Implementation

The project utilizes the standard Mongoose OS configuration architecture. The `Config.Get.json` file reveals a sophisticated setup including:

- **MQTT Configuration**: Pre-configured for local or cloud brokers with support for SSL/TLS and clean sessions.
- **System Monitoring**: Watchdog timer (WDT) settings and debug logging levels are tuned for stability.
- **Network Services**: Integrated HTTP server, DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), and SNTP for time synchronization.

## Hardware Support

While Mongoose OS is cross-platform, this repository specifically targets:
- **ESP32**: Utilized for more complex tasks requiring multiple SPI channels and extensive GPIO mapping.
- **ESP8266**: Used for simpler IoT nodes, as seen in the default device IDs within the configuration files.

## Getting Started

To use these programs, developers typically require the `mos` tool installed on their local machine. The repository includes command-line snippets for configuring GCP IoT Core, which can be executed via the `mos` CLI to provision devices and set up the necessary IAM policies and Pub/Sub topics on the Google Cloud side. The presence of `arduino-examples` also suggests that some components may be compatible with or inspired by the Arduino ecosystem, providing a bridge for developers transitioning to the Mongoose OS environment.
