## Overview

micropython-lib is the official repository of packages designed to extend the functionality of MicroPython applications. While the core MicroPython runtime provides the essential Python language features and hardware-specific modules, micropython-lib serves as the central hub for higher-level libraries, drivers, and standard library replacements. 

The project aims to bridge the gap between the full CPython environment and the resource-constrained world of microcontrollers by providing modular, lightweight implementations of familiar Python tools.

## Package Categories

The repository is organized into four primary categories to help developers find the right tools for their specific needs:

*   **python-stdlib**: These are compatible versions of modules from the Python Standard Library. They act as drop-in replacements for CPython modules, though they often feature reduced functionality to fit within the memory constraints of embedded devices.
*   **python-ecosys**: This category contains reduced-functionality versions of popular packages from the wider Python ecosystem, such as those typically found on PyPI.
*   **micropython**: These are packages specific to the MicroPython environment. This includes hardware drivers for sensors, displays, and peripherals, as well as libraries for embedded-specific functionality like Bluetooth (aioble) or specialized networking tools.
*   **unix-ffi**: Specifically for the MicroPython Unix port, these packages provide access to operating system and third-party libraries via the Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

## Installation and Management

Modern MicroPython environments offer several ways to integrate these packages into a project:

### On-Device Installation with mip
As of MicroPython v1.20, boards with network connectivity include the `mip` package manager. This allows for direct installation of packages over WiFi or Ethernet:

```python
import mip
mip.install("package-name")
```

### PC-Based Management with mpremote
For devices without direct network access, the `mpremote` tool can be used from a host PC to install packages onto a connected MicroPython device via the command line:

```bash
$ mpremote connect /dev/ttyUSB0 mip install package-name
```

### Firmware Freezing
For production environments where performance and memory efficiency are critical, packages can be "frozen" into the firmware. Every package in micropython-lib includes a `manifest.py` file, allowing developers to include specific modules during the firmware build process using the `require()` command.

## Technical Architecture and Conventions

micropython-lib follows strict conventions to ensure code remains minimal and efficient. A key concept is the "extension package," where larger libraries are broken into smaller chunks. For example, `collections-defaultdict` extends the base `collections` package, allowing users to only install the specific classes they need, saving precious flash and RAM.

All packages are encouraged to include `manifest.py` files with metadata and use `unittest` for verification. While the code is kept minimal, docstrings are encouraged as they are stripped during the cross-compilation to bytecode, ensuring that documentation does not impact the final footprint on the device.
