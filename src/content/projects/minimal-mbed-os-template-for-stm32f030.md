## Overview

The STM32F030F4 is a popular, low-cost ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller, but its 16KB of Flash and 4KB of RAM present a significant challenge for modern RTOS frameworks. This project provides a minimal template for using Mbed OS on these barebones chips, demonstrating that even resource-heavy frameworks can be pruned to fit into small-footprint devices.

By leveraging the PlatformIO ecosystem, this template simplifies the setup process for developers looking to use Mbed's high-level APIs without the overhead typically associated with the platform. It is particularly useful for small IoT nodes or simple control applications where the developer prefers the Mbed OS environment over bare-metal CMSIS or HAL development.

## Memory Optimization Strategies

To make Mbed OS viable on a device with only 16KB of Flash, several aggressive optimization techniques are employed:

- **Disabling Standard I/O**: The project disables the default Mbed `stdio` library support, which significantly reduces the binary size.
- **Alternative Printf**: Instead of the standard library's heavy printf implementation, the project integrates a lightweight version specifically designed for embedded systems.
- **Newlib-Nano**: The build configuration utilizes `newlib-nano` to further minimize the memory footprint.
- **Custom Linker Script**: A specialized linker script (`stm32f030f4_ld_script.ld`) is included to define the exact memory layout for the STM32F030F4, ensuring code and data are placed efficiently within the 16KB Flash and 4KB RAM boundaries.

## Technical Configuration

The project is configured via `platformio.ini` and targets the STM32F030 series. It uses the `ststm32` platform and the Mbed framework. Key configuration flags include:

- **C++ Standard**: Set to C++17 for modern language features.
- **UART Configuration**: Default serial communication is mapped to `PA_9` (TX) and `PA_10` (RX) with a baud rate of 115200.
- **Build Flags**: The configuration explicitly unsets `DEVICE_STDIO_MESSAGES` and sets `HAS_FLOAT=0` to avoid pulling in heavy floating-point libraries unless necessary.

## Hardware Integration

The template is designed for barebones STM32F030F4 chips, often found in TSSOP20 packages. For programming and debugging, the project supports the ST-LINK/V2 programmer. The README provides a wiring guide for the minimum connections required to flash the device, including SWDIO, SWCLK, GND, and VCC.

## Getting Started

Since the project is based on PlatformIO, the workflow is straightforward. Developers can compile and flash the firmware using standard PlatformIO commands:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

For debugging and viewing logs, the project is pre-configured for a serial monitor at 115200 baud:

```bash
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

This template serves as an excellent starting point for developers who want the productivity of Mbed OS on the most cost-effective STM32 hardware available.
