KRATOS (The Contiki Operating System for LoRa Chipsets) is a specialized fork of Contiki OS 3.0, tailored specifically for low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) research. Developed to bridge the gap between traditional wireless sensor networks and modern LoRa technology, KRATOS provides a robust software platform for developers working with the Semtech SX1276 transceiver and the TI MSP430FR5969 microcontroller.

### The Core of KRATOS
At its heart, KRATOS is a stripped-down version of Contiki 3.0. By removing unnecessary legacy components, the project focuses on the essential requirements for LoRa-based communication. It retains the core strengths of Contiki, such as the protothreads programming model, while introducing specific optimizations for the LoRa physical layer. This makes it an ideal platform for researchers looking to implement custom MAC protocols or energy-efficient scheduling algorithms.

### Key Technical Features
One of the standout features of KRATOS is its implementation of **On-Demand LoRa**. This involves an asynchronous TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) scheme designed to provide energy-efficient and low-latency communication. Unlike standard LoRaWAN, which often relies on ALOHA-based access, the research-oriented protocols included in KRATOS allow for more deterministic data collection, which is critical for industrial IoT and high-reliability monitoring applications.

The system includes several core Contiki modules:
- **Rime Stack**: A lightweight networking stack for low-power wireless networks.
- **CFS (Contiki File System)**: Support for Coffee and POSIX-style file operations.
- **CTK (Contiki Toolkit)**: A graphical toolkit for user interface elements.
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Specialized drivers for the SX1276 LoRa radio and the MSP430FR5969 platform.

### Hardware Support
The project is primarily designed for the **EXP-MSP430FR5969** platform. This TI LaunchPad features a 16-bit RISC architecture with 64KB of FRAM, which is particularly well-suited for low-power applications due to its fast, non-volatile memory writes. When integrated with the **SX1276 LoRa transceiver**, KRATOS provides a complete hardware-software stack for LPWAN experimentation.

### Getting Started with Examples
The repository includes several practical examples to help developers jumpstart their projects. These are located in the `examples/` directory and include:
- **LoRa-receiver & LoRa-transmitter**: Basic templates for point-to-point LoRa communication.
- **button-test**: Demonstrates hardware interrupt handling and sensor integration.
- **printf-test**: A utility for debugging via serial output.

To compile an example, such as the transmitter, you would typically navigate to the directory and use the provided Makefile:

```makefile
ifndef TARGET
TARGET=expfr5969
endif

CONTIKI_PROJECT = transmitter transmitter.hex
all: $(CONTIKI_PROJECT)
CONTIKI = ../..
CONTIKI_WITH_RIME = 1

include $(CONTIKI)/Makefile.include
```

### Research and Publications
KRATOS is not just a hobbyist project; it is the foundation for several peer-reviewed research papers. These publications explore asynchronous TDMA for energy efficiency and the use of wake-up receivers in conjunction with LoRa. For developers and academics interested in the cutting edge of LPWAN technology, KRATOS offers a transparent, open-source environment to test new theories and protocols in real-world scenarios.
