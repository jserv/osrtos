## Overview

The RTEMS Raspberry Pi Testing project provides a suite of test cases and device drivers specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi Board Support Package (BSP) within the RTEMS Real-Time Operating System. This repository serves as a practical implementation and validation ground for peripheral support on one of the most popular embedded platforms.

Originally developed as part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects in 2013 and 2015, this codebase bridges the gap between the RTEMS kernel and the hardware-specific requirements of the Raspberry Pi's Broadcom SoC. It focuses on essential communication protocols and general-purpose I/O, ensuring that developers can reliably interact with external hardware in a real-time environment.

## Key Components and Peripheral Support

The project is organized into specific modules targeting the primary communication buses and interfaces available on the Raspberry Pi hardware:

### RTEMS GPIO API
One of the core contributions of this project is the implementation and testing of the RTEMS GPIO API. This provides a standardized way to interact with the General Purpose Input/Output pins, allowing for digital signal control and monitoring. The test cases included ensure that the GPIO implementation adheres to the expected RTEMS API behavior, providing a stable foundation for higher-level drivers.

### SPI Bus Drivers
The SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) module includes both the device drivers for the Raspberry Pi's SPI controller and the corresponding test cases. SPI is critical for interfacing with high-speed sensors, displays, and flash memory. By providing validated drivers, the project enables RTEMS applications to communicate with a wide array of industrial and hobbyist peripherals.

### I2C Bus Drivers
Similar to the SPI implementation, the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) module provides the necessary driver logic and verification tests for the I2C bus. This is essential for connecting low-speed peripherals such as RTCs (Real-Time Clocks), temperature sensors, and EEPROMs. 

## Technical Context

RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a high-performance RTOS used in space flight, medical devices, and industrial control. Bringing robust support to the Raspberry Pi platform via these drivers makes RTEMS more accessible for rapid prototyping and educational purposes. 

The project leverages the work done during GSoC 2013 and 2015, which focused on expanding the Raspberry Pi BSP peripherals and SD card support. These efforts have been instrumental in making the Raspberry Pi a viable target for RTEMS-based real-time applications, providing the necessary middleware and driver layers that sit between the hardware and the application logic.
