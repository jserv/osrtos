## Overview

The HX711 library for Mongoose OS is a specialized port of the popular Arduino HX711 library. It is designed to interface with the Avia Semiconductor HX711, a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) specifically engineered for weigh scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor.

By bringing this library to the Mongoose OS ecosystem, developers can easily integrate weight sensing capabilities into their IoT projects. Mongoose OS provides a robust framework for connected devices, and this library bridges the gap for those needing high-precision analog measurements on platforms like the ESP32 or ESP8266.

## Key Features

This library provides the necessary drivers to communicate with the HX711 chip using a simple two-wire interface (clock and data). Key capabilities include:

- **High-Precision Reading**: Access to the 24-bit raw data from the ADC.
- **Adjustable Gain**: Support for different gain settings (128, 64, or 32) to suit various sensor requirements.
- **Power Management**: Support for power-down modes, which is critical for battery-operated IoT devices.
- **Mongoose OS Integration**: Fully compatible with the `mos` build tool and configuration schema.

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured as a standard Mongoose OS library (`type: lib`). A significant technical detail is its dependency on the `arduino-compat` library. This compatibility layer allows the library to use Arduino-style APIs within the Mongoose OS environment, making it easier to maintain parity with the original Arduino source code while benefiting from Mongoose OS features like over-the-air (OTA) updates, remote management, and built-in networking.

The library source code is organized into standard directories:
- `src`: Contains the C/C++ implementation files.
- `include`: Contains the header files for API access.
- `mos.yml`: Defines the library metadata, dependencies, and build configuration.

## Getting Started

To use this library in a Mongoose OS project, developers add it to the `libs` section of their project's `mos.yml` manifest. Because it utilizes the `arduino-compat` layer, the programming model remains familiar to those who have previously worked with the HX711 on Arduino-based platforms.

Typical use cases for this library include:
- **Smart Scales**: Building connected kitchen or bathroom scales.
- **Industrial Monitoring**: Tracking inventory levels in silos or tanks using load cells.
- **Force Sensing**: Measuring mechanical stress or pressure in structural health monitoring systems.

The library's integration with Mongoose OS makes it an ideal choice for developers looking to move from a prototype on Arduino to a production-ready, cloud-connected IoT device.
