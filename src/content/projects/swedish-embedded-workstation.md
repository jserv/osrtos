## Overview

The Swedish Embedded Workstation is a complete, Linux-based development environment designed to streamline the complex process of setting up an embedded firmware development workflow. While setting up toolchains, SDKs, and simulation environments can often take days, this project provides a "batteries-included" approach using Docker to deliver a consistent, reproducible environment for developers and CI/CD pipelines alike.

Primarily focused on the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, the workstation integrates everything from low-level compilers to high-level simulation tools and sophisticated text editors, ensuring that developers have a professional-grade toolkit ready out of the box.

## Layered Docker Architecture

The project is built around a series of specialized Docker images, each serving a specific purpose in the development lifecycle:

- **Base Image (ci-base):** A minimal environment containing the essential software needed for basic development tasks without the heavy toolchains.
- **CI Image (ci):** Designed for automated testing and continuous integration, this image includes the Zephyr SDK, cross-compilation toolchains, and packages required for CI operations.
- **Developer Image (zephyr-build):** An extension of the CI image that adds tools specifically useful for active Zephyr development, such as debugging utilities and additional libraries.
- **Workstation Image:** The most comprehensive version, providing a full integrated development environment (IDE). It includes pre-configured versions of Emacs (Doom Emacs), Neovim, Tmux, and even window manager configurations for i3wm.

## Technical Capabilities and Tooling

The workstation is packed with industry-standard tools for embedded systems engineering:

- **Zephyr RTOS Integration:** Full support for the Zephyr SDK (version 0.16.3) and the `west` meta-tool for managing repositories and builds.
- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Includes toolchains and Rust targets for a wide array of architectures, including ARM Cortex-M (thumbv6m, thumbv7m, thumbv8m), RISC-V (32 and 64-bit), and x86_64.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Integrated support for Renode and Babblesim (BSIM) allows developers to run and test firmware in a simulated environment, which is crucial for automated testing and development when hardware is unavailable.
- **Advanced Tooling:** The environment includes LLVM/Clang 18, Protobuf compilers, static analysis tools like Sparse, and hardware-related tools like KiCad and KiBot for PCB automation.

## Development Workflow

The workstation simplifies common tasks such as building sample applications. For example, building a standard "Hello World" for QEMU or a native POSIX application is handled through standard Zephyr commands within the container:

```bash
west build -b qemu_x86 samples/hello_world
west build -t run
```

One unique feature is the ability to run display-based applications (like those using the Zephyr display subsystem) through a VNC connection. By forwarding port 5900, developers can interact with a virtual display generated by a `native_posix` build directly from their host machine.

## Integrated IDE Experience

Beyond just a build environment, the Swedish Embedded Workstation provides a highly customized user experience. It includes:
- **Doom Emacs:** A fast, modular configuration for Emacs.
- **Neovim:** Pre-configured with language servers (LSP) for C, C++, Python, and Rust.
- **Tmux & Tmuxinator:** For managing complex terminal sessions and layouts.
- **Language Servers:** Built-in support for `clangd`, `bash-language-server`, and `yamllint` to provide real-time code feedback.

This project represents a significant effort to standardize embedded development, making it easier for teams to maintain consistent environments across different machines and automated build servers.
