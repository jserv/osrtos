## Overview

Zephyr GRBL is a specialized port of the popular GRBL CNC firmware to the Zephyr Real-Time Operating System. Originally developed for a CoreXY pen plotter, this project leverages Zephyr's hardware abstraction layers to run GRBL on more powerful 32-bit microcontrollers, specifically targeting the STM32F4 series. By moving away from the traditional 8-bit AVR architecture, the project gains access to advanced features like software CDC ACM serial ports, SD card support for standalone operation, and modern stepper driver integration.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The port maintains the core motion control logic of GRBL while introducing several enhancements enabled by the Zephyr ecosystem:

- **Broad Hardware Support**: While primarily tested on the STM32F405RG and STM32F446RE, the use of Zephyr's device tree and driver model makes it portable to other STM32 variants with minimal configuration changes.
- **Integrated Storage**: Support for SD cards over SPI using Zephyr's disk access and FAT file system modules.
- **Advanced Stepper Control**: Integration with TMC2130 stepper drivers, including support for SPI-based configuration.
- **User Interface**: Support for SSD1306-based OLED displays to provide status updates and feedback.
- **USB Connectivity**: Implementation of a software CDC ACM serial port, allowing the device to appear as a standard COM port without dedicated USB-to-serial hardware.

## Technical Implementation

One of the most significant technical hurdles in porting GRBL to Zephyr was the timing-critical nature of stepper pulse generation. The project introduces a custom `hw_timer` module, derived from Zephyr's PWM driver. This module is designed to fire callbacks on timer update events, providing the high-precision interrupts required for the Bresenham line algorithm used in GRBL's motion control.

To ensure compatibility with Zephyr's scheduler, the main GRBL loop was modified to include `k_yield()` calls. This allows lower-priority threads, such as logging, shell access, and USB management, to execute without interfering with the high-priority motion control tasks. The project also utilizes Zephyr's NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) for settings and the Interrupt UART API for efficient communication.

## Porting Details

The porting process involved several key modifications to the original GRBL source:
- Adding `extern "C"` blocks to headers to support C++ interoperability.
- Mapping AVR-specific GPIO register code to Zephyr's GPIO API.
- Implementing a custom PWM-to-timer callback bridge for step generation.
- Porting EEPROM logic to Zephyr's NVS system.
- Adapting the UART code to use Zephyr's ring buffers and interrupt-driven APIs.

## Getting Started

The project follows the standard Zephyr build workflow using `west`. It is configured to build for the `plotter_f405rg` board definition provided in the repository. Users can communicate with the firmware using standard G-code senders or via the integrated shell. Example commands for unlocking the machine ($X), homing, and performing manual jogs are supported, making it a functional base for various CNC and plotter applications.
