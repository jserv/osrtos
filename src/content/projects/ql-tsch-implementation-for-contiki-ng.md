## Overview

The QL-TSCH implementation project introduces a Q-Learning based scheduling protocol for Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) within the Contiki-NG ecosystem. TSCH is a critical component of the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, designed to provide high reliability and low power consumption in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) by combining time-slotted access with channel hopping. This project specifically modifies the core Contiki-NG files to implement intelligent scheduling logic.

## Enhancing TSCH with Q-Learning

Standard TSCH schedules are often static or use the 6TiSCH minimal schedule. This project replaces or augments those mechanisms with reinforcement learning. By leveraging Q-Learning, the system can dynamically adapt its communication schedule based on observed network conditions. This approach aims to improve throughput and reduce packet collisions in dense or interference-prone environments by learning the optimal slots for transmission.

## Technical Configuration and Implementation

The implementation is highly configurable through the `project-conf.h` header, which defines the operational parameters of the TSCH stack. Key technical features include:

- **Slotframe Management**: The project defines specific lengths for different traffic types, such as a broadcast slotframe length of 7 and a unicast slotframe length of 15.
- **MAC Layer Tuning**: It configures essential IEEE 802.15.4 parameters, including a custom PAN ID (0x81a5) and a maximum of 3 frame retries.
- **QL-TSCH Integration**: The logic is toggled via the `QL_TSCH_ENABLED_CONF` macro. It also includes advanced features like `WITH_TSCH_LOCKING` to ensure the algorithm runs safely within the timing constraints of the TSCH slot.
- **Drift Compensation**: To maintain synchronization during complex calculations, the project implements drift compensation (defined as `EXTRA_TIME`) to account for the processing overhead of the Q-Learning algorithm.

## Simulation and Development

The project is primarily targeted at the **Cooja** simulator, the standard simulation environment for Contiki-NG. This allows for rigorous testing of the Q-Learning scheduling logic across various network topologies and interference patterns without requiring physical hardware deployments. The build system is configured to prioritize the Cooja platform, making it an ideal starting point for researchers studying intelligent MAC protocols.

## Application Structure

The repository includes a `node.c` file that demonstrates a typical application use case. It sets up a UDP-based communication pattern with a defined sending interval (30 seconds) and payload size (50 bytes). This provides a baseline for evaluating how the QL-TSCH scheduler handles periodic sensor data traffic. The application also utilizes a custom packet-ready callback (`my_callback_packet_ready`) to interface with the TSCH link selector, allowing the Q-Learning agent to make informed decisions about packet scheduling.
