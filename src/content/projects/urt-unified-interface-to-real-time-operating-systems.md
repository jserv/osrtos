title: 'URT: Unified Interface to Real-Time Operating Systems'
summary: A unified C interface for real-time operating systems that simplifies development
  across POSIX, RTAI, and Xenomai. It provides a consistent API for task management,
  shared memory, and synchronization, allowing real-time applications to be developed
  and debugged on standard Linux before deployment.

URT (Unified Interface to Real-Time Operating Systems) is a middleware library designed to bridge the gap between various real-time environments. In the world of embedded and real-time systems, software is often tightly coupled to a specific RTOS API—such as RTAI, Xenomai, or POSIX—making porting difficult and time-consuming. URT addresses this by providing a "sane" and consistent interface to common real-time facilities.

### The Core Philosophy

The project focuses on three primary pillars: portability, simplicity, and debuggability. By abstracting the underlying system calls, URT allows developers to write code that can run on a standard Linux desktop for testing and then move to a hard real-time environment like RTAI with minimal changes.

One of the standout features is the focus on **debuggability**. Because URT includes a normal Linux backend, developers can use standard tools like `valgrind` to check for memory leaks or `gdb` for debugging logic, which is often significantly harder to do within a specialized real-time kernel module or a restricted RTOS environment.

### Simplified Real-Time Primitives

Standard interfaces like POSIX are powerful but can be verbose and irregular. For instance, setting up shared memory or acquiring shared semaphores often requires dozens of lines of boilerplate code. URT simplifies these operations into intuitive functions. For example, `urt_shmem_new` provides a shared memory counterpart to `malloc` with similar ease of use.

**Supported Facilities Include:**
- **Task Management**: Unified creation and control of real-time tasks across different kernels.
- **Synchronization**: Consistent APIs for mutexes, semaphores, read-write locks, and condition variables.
- **Memory Management**: Simple interfaces for both local and shared memory allocation.
- **Registry**: A mechanism for naming and discovering shared objects across the system.

### Architecture and Backends

URT is designed with a modular architecture that abstracts the specificities of the underlying operating system. Currently, the project supports several key environments:
- **POSIX**: Targets standard Linux (for non-real-time testing) and provides a path for QNX or VxWorks support.
- **RTAI**: Supports both user-space (LXRT) and kernel-space modules, allowing for hard real-time performance on Linux.
- **Planned Support**: The architecture is designed to eventually encompass Xenomai and RT-Linux (PREEMPT_RT) patches.

The library is written in C99 and utilizes the Autotools build system, making it highly compatible with standard cross-compilation workflows. It also includes Python bindings (`urt-py`), enabling high-level scripting and rapid prototyping of real-time components.

### Getting Started

Building URT follows the standard `configure && make` workflow. Developers can specify the target backend during the configuration stage using the `--with-back-end` flag. To assist with integration into larger projects, URT provides a `urt-config` script. This tool provides the necessary compiler and linker flags, ensuring that the correct headers and libraries are used for the chosen RTOS backend.

For developers working in complex environments, URT supports a "suffix" configuration. This allows multiple versions of the library (for example, one configured for POSIX and another for RTAI) to coexist on the same filesystem without naming conflicts, which is particularly useful for hybrid development and testing cycles.
