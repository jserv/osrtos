## Overview

The NCS-MIDI project provides a robust foundation for developing MIDI applications using the nRF Connect SDK (NCS). Built on top of the Zephyr RTOS, this repository offers a collection of samples and subsystems designed to handle MIDI data over both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and traditional serial interfaces. It is specifically tailored for developers working with Nordic Semiconductor hardware who need to implement low-latency musical instrument interfaces.

## Key Features and Samples

The repository is structured around several core samples that demonstrate different MIDI roles and transport layers:

- **Bluetooth Central MIDI**: Implements a BLE-MIDI central device capable of scanning for and connecting to MIDI peripherals.
- **Bluetooth Peripheral MIDI**: Allows the nRF device to act as a MIDI instrument or controller that can be discovered and played by other BLE-MIDI hosts (like tablets or computers).
- **Serial MIDI**: Provides support for traditional 5-pin DIN MIDI or MIDI-over-UART, allowing integration with legacy musical hardware.

## Technical Implementation

As an nRF Connect SDK project, NCS-MIDI leverages the `west` meta-tool for dependency management and build orchestration. The project integrates deeply with the Zephyr RTOS ecosystem, utilizing its Bluetooth stack and peripheral drivers. 

The repository includes a dedicated MIDI subsystem (`subsys`) and library components (`lib`) that abstract the complexities of MIDI message parsing and BLE-MIDI packetization. This modular approach allows developers to easily incorporate MIDI functionality into their own custom firmware projects.

## Timing and Performance

One of the most critical aspects of MIDI development is latency and jitter. Because musical performance requires high precision, this project places a strong emphasis on timing optimization. The developers have provided extensive resources on optimizing the BLE-MIDI stack specifically for timing-sensitive applications, ensuring that the transition from a physical action (like a key press) to a MIDI message is as instantaneous as possible within the constraints of the Bluetooth protocol.

## Getting Started

To use these samples, developers need a functional nRF Connect SDK environment. The project is designed to be initialized as a `west` workspace, which automatically pulls in the necessary dependencies from the Nordic Semiconductor SDK repositories. Once the environment is set up, the samples can be built and flashed to supported Nordic hardware (such as the nRF52 or nRF53 series) using standard NCS development workflows.
