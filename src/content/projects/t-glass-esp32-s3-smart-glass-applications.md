The T-Glass v2 project offers a specialized ecosystem for developers looking to build and deploy applications on an affordable, ESP32-S3-based smart glasses platform. Priced at a fraction of high-end wearables, it provides a feature-rich environment for exploring IoT, wearable interfaces, and sensor integration.

### High-Performance Wearable Hardware

At the heart of the T-Glass v2 is the ESP32-S3-FN4R2 SoC, which provides robust processing power along with 4MB of Flash and 2MB of PSRAM. The device is equipped with a 1.1-inch JD9613 LTPS AMOLED display, ensuring that information is crisp and readable even in a compact form factor.

Beyond the display, the hardware suite includes:
- **Bosch BHI260AP**: A smart sensor hub that handles motion tracking and IMU data efficiently.
- **PCF85063A RTC**: Ensures accurate timekeeping for standalone wearable functions.
- **Audio and Input**: An integrated microphone and a touch-sensitive button allow for multi-modal user interaction.

### Specialized Applications

The repository is organized into specific application modules, each targeting different capabilities of the wearable platform:

- **iOS Notification System (ANCS)**: By implementing the Apple Notification Center Service (ANCS) over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the glasses can act as a secondary display for iPhone notifications, keeping users informed without needing to check their mobile devices.
- **Image Capture**: This application demonstrates the device's ability to interface with external systems via BLE to trigger or manage image capture tasks.
- **Motion and Time Tracking**: Leveraging the onboard Bosch sensors and Real-Time Clock, the platform is capable of sophisticated activity monitoring and time-based alerts.

### Development Environment

The project is built on the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework). This choice provides developers with deep access to the ESP32-S3's hardware features, including its dual-core architecture and advanced power management. Because ESP-IDF is built on FreeRTOS, the applications benefit from a mature real-time operating system environment, enabling efficient task scheduling for sensor polling, display updates, and wireless communication.

For those interested in the intersection of wearable hardware and open-source software, the T-Glass Applications repository provides both a starting point and a set of functional tools to transform a programmable device into a custom smart wearable.
