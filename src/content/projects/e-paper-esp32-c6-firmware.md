## Overview

The E-Paper ESP32-C6 Firmware is a specialized software stack designed for the OpenPaper 7, a high-quality electronic paper display device. Built on the ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1, this firmware leverages the RISC-V based microcontroller's capabilities to provide a low-power, connected experience for driving large-format E-Ink displays, specifically the Spectra 6 7.3-inch (EL073TF1).

The project is developed using the Arduino framework within the PlatformIO ecosystem, ensuring a robust and modular codebase that handles everything from cloud synchronization to hardware-level display driving.

## Connectivity and Cloud Integration

A core feature of this firmware is its deep integration with AWS IoT Core. The device uses AWS IoT for activation, status reporting, and retrieving image data. Security is handled via unique device certificates stored in the SPIFFS filesystem, following a naming convention based on the device's MAC address. This ensures that each unit in the field has a unique identity and secure communication channel.

For initial setup, the firmware includes a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) provisioning system. Using the NimBLE-Arduino library, the device advertises its presence, allowing users to configure WiFi credentials and other settings without needing a physical connection. The advertising service is designed to be resilient, automatically restarting after client disconnections to ensure the device remains accessible during the setup phase.

## Hardware and Power Management

To maximize battery life, the firmware implements sophisticated power management strategies. The ESP32-C6 enters deep sleep modes, waking up only when necessary. Wake-up triggers include:
- **Timer-based wakeups**: Configurable via MQTT commands from the cloud.
- **Motion detection**: Utilizing the KXTJ3-1057 accelerometer to wake the device when moved.
- **User interaction**: Physical button presses for manual refreshes or resets.

The display logic is powered by the GxEPD2 library and Adafruit GFX, providing high-quality rendering for the Spectra 6's unique color capabilities. The firmware also manages a complex memory map in flash/EEPROM to store persistent states such as WiFi credentials, display orientation, and activation flags.

## Technical Implementation

The build system is managed via PlatformIO, with custom Python scripts (`set_env.py`) used to inject environment variables from a `.env` file into the build process. This allows for easy configuration of OTA (Over-the-Air) update URLs and default network settings. The project also includes Azure Pipelines configurations for automated CI/CD, facilitating the generation of production and development firmware binaries.

### Key Components:
- **Framework**: Arduino (ESP32-C6 core)
- **Display Driver**: GxEPD2 with U8g2 for GFX fonts
- **Networking**: WiFi with MQTT for cloud messaging
- **Provisioning**: BLE via NimBLE
- **Updates**: esp32FOTA for seamless remote firmware management
- **Storage**: SPIFFS for certificates and EEPROM for configuration data

## Getting Started

Developers looking to work with this firmware should set up a PlatformIO environment in Visual Studio Code. The project requires a `.env` file for configuration and specific AWS IoT certificates placed in the `data` folder before being uploaded to the SPIFFS partition. Once configured, the firmware can be built and flashed to an ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1, providing a complete solution for connected E-Paper applications.
