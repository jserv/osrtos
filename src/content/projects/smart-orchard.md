title: Smart Orchard
summary: An IoT application for smart orchard monitoring and management based on the
  Contiki-NG operating system. It features a network of CoAP-enabled sensors and actuators,
  a border router for cloud connectivity, and a Java-based backend for data processing
  and control. The system is designed to be simulated in the Cooja environment, allowing
  for extensive testing of network topologies and automated irrigation logic.

The Smart Orchard project represents a modern approach to precision agriculture, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to provide farmers with real-time insights into their crops. By integrating low-power wireless sensors and actuators, the system enables automated monitoring and intervention, such as smart irrigation management.

### System Architecture

The project is built upon the Contiki-NG operating system, a leading OS for the Industrial IoT. The architecture consists of three primary layers:

1.  **The Sensor/Actuator Layer**: These are the "motes" or end-nodes deployed in the field. In this project, they are implemented as CoAP servers. Specifically, the `coap_server_sprinkler.c` component handles both environmental sensing and the control of irrigation hardware (sprinklers).
2.  **The Border Router**: This node acts as the gateway between the low-power wireless mesh network (6LoWPAN) and the traditional IP network. It facilitates communication between the field nodes and the cloud-based management application.
3.  **The Cloud/Management Layer**: A Java-based application built with Maven that communicates with the motes via the CoAP protocol. This application provides the logic for data aggregation and remote command execution.

### Communication Protocol

The system relies heavily on CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), a specialized web transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and networks. By using CoAP, the project ensures efficient data transfer over low-power wireless links while maintaining compatibility with RESTful web services. The Java backend acts as a CoAP client or manager, interacting with the resources exposed by the sprinkler nodes.

### Simulation and Development

A significant portion of the project is designed for simulation within the Cooja environment. Cooja allows developers to test network topologies and node behavior without requiring physical hardware. The repository includes a `simulation.csc` file, which pre-configures a network consisting of a border router and multiple sensor-actuator nodes.

To bridge the simulated network with the host machine, the project uses a serial socket connection. This allows the Java application running on the host (or in a container) to interact with the simulated motes as if they were physical devices connected via a hardware gateway.

### Getting Started

Deployment involves a multi-step process:
- **Mote Firmware**: Compiling the border router and CoAP server code for the Cooja target using the Contiki-NG toolchain.
- **Network Setup**: Running the simulation in Cooja and establishing the router connection using `make TARGET=cooja connect-router-cooja`.
- **Backend Execution**: Compiling the Java application using Maven (`mvn package`) and running the resulting JAR file to start the monitoring service.

This integrated approach provides a robust framework for developing and testing smart agriculture solutions in a virtualized environment before moving to physical hardware deployment.
