## Overview

FreeRTOS-HIFI4-DSP is an implementation of the FreeRTOS kernel tailored for the Cadence Tensilica HiFi 4 DSP. While most development for this architecture typically relies on proprietary tools like Xtensa Xplorer and the XCC compiler, this project provides a path for developers to use the open-source GCC compiler. It serves as a foundational platform for running real-time tasks on DSP cores often found in modern SoCs.

It is important to note that this is a community-driven project and not an official RTOS SDK from Cadence. While it provides the core FreeRTOS scheduling and synchronization primitives, it currently does not support specific hardware-accelerated DSP features of the HiFi 4 core.

## Technical Implementation

The project includes a complete port of the FreeRTOS kernel, including task management, queue systems, and memory management (using `heap_4`). The architecture-specific code is located within the `arch` and `kernel/portable` directories, handling critical low-level operations such as:

- **Interrupt Handling**: Support for multiple interrupt levels and NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt) handling.
- **Context Switching**: Assembly-level implementation of Xtensa context saving and restoring.
- **Vector Table**: Custom linker scripts and assembly files to manage the Xtensa vector base and reset vectors.

### Memory Layout

The project uses a sophisticated linker script (`link.ld`) that defines several memory segments, primarily focusing on Instruction RAM (IRAM) and External DDR memory. The layout is optimized for the Xtensa architecture, ensuring that reset vectors and exception handlers are placed in the correct memory-mapped locations required by the hardware.

## Benchmarking

To validate performance and stability on the HiFi 4 target, the repository includes several industry-standard benchmarks:

- **CoreMark**: Measures the performance of central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded systems.
- **Dhrystone**: A synthetic computing benchmark for integer performance.
- **Linpack**: A measure of a system's floating-point computing power.

These benchmarks are integrated directly into the build system, allowing developers to verify the efficiency of the GCC-compiled firmware compared to proprietary alternatives.

## Firmware Loading and Integration

Since DSPs typically act as co-processors to a main application processor, this project provides resources for loading the compiled binary into the DSP's memory. It references the **SyterKit** loader and includes a dedicated **U-Boot driver** located in the `host/uboot-driver/dsp` directory. This allows a Linux-based host or a bootloader to initialize the DSP core and start the FreeRTOS firmware.

## Getting Started

The build process is managed via a standard Makefile. It requires a specific Xtensa HiFi 4 GCC toolchain. Once the toolchain is configured, the project can be compiled by simply running `make`. The resulting ELF file is then stripped and processed into a format suitable for the firmware loader. 

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YuzukiHD/FreeRTOS-HIFI4-DSP.git

# Build the project
make
```

The build system generates not only the final binary but also disassembly and readelf files, which are invaluable for debugging low-level architecture issues on the DSP.
