## Overview

The mgos-bme680 library provides a seamless integration for the Bosch Sensortec BME680 environmental sensor within the Mongoose OS ecosystem. The BME680 is a sophisticated 4-in-1 digital sensor that measures gas, pressure, humidity, and temperature, making it an ideal choice for mobile and wearable devices, as well as smart home and IoT applications where air quality monitoring is essential.

This library acts as a wrapper around the official Bosch BME680 driver, ensuring that the low-level sensor logic remains consistent with the manufacturer's specifications while providing the high-level abstractions required for Mongoose OS projects.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Environmental Sensing**: Access data for temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) gas resistance.
- **Dual Interface Support**: Flexible hardware connectivity via both 4-wire SPI and I2C interfaces.
- **Official Driver Integration**: Built upon the Bosch BME680_driver to ensure accurate sensor calibration and data processing.
- **Mongoose OS Native**: Designed to work with the `mos` build tool and compatible with the Mongoose OS library system, including support for C and JavaScript (MJS) bindings.

## Technical Implementation

The library is structured to be easily included in any Mongoose OS application. By defining dependencies in the `mos.yml` file, developers can pull in the necessary I2C or SPI libraries automatically. The source code includes the vendor-provided driver, which handles the complex calculations required to convert raw ADC readings into meaningful environmental units.

Because Mongoose OS supports multiple architectures, this library is typically used on hardware such as the ESP32 or ESP8266, providing a robust path for developers to build connected environmental monitors. The inclusion of `mjs_fs` suggests that the library is prepared for use with Mongoose OS's JavaScript engine, allowing for rapid prototyping of sensor logic without writing low-level C code for every application iteration.

## Getting Started

To use this library in a Mongoose OS project, it is added to the `libs` section of the project's `mos.yml` file. Once included, the sensor can be initialized using the standard Mongoose OS I2C or SPI bus abstractions. 

The library handles the initialization of the BME680, including setting the oversampling rates and filter settings. Developers can then poll the sensor or set up timers to read the environmental data at specific intervals. This data can then be published to cloud services like AWS IoT, Google IoT Core, or Microsoft Azure via the built-in networking capabilities of Mongoose OS.
