## Overview

The ESP8266 Home Automation project is a suite of IoT firmwares designed for the NodeMCU and other ESP8266-based hardware. It provides practical solutions for common home automation tasks, specifically focusing on remote computer power management and smart lighting. By utilizing the MQTT protocol, these devices can be easily integrated into broader home automation ecosystems like Home Assistant or OpenHAB.

## Key Firmwares

### Wake on Lan (WoL) via MQTT
One of the primary modules in this repository is a Wake on Lan controller. Unlike traditional software-based WoL, which often fails if a computer's wireless card does not support magic packets in low-power states, this hardware-based solution interacts directly with the motherboard. The ESP8266 acts as an MQTT client listening to a specific topic (e.g., `wol/push`). When a message is received, the device shorts the power switch circuit for a brief duration, emulating a physical button press to toggle the computer's power state.

### RGB LED Stripe Control
The second major component is an IoT-enabled LED stripe controller. This firmware allows for remote control of RGB LED strips. The ESP8266 subscribes to light events via MQTT (e.g., `lights/push`), processing incoming color data to drive the Red, Green, and Blue channels of the connected stripe. This enables seamless integration of ambient lighting into a smart home setup.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built using the Arduino framework for ESP8266 and incorporates several sophisticated modules to ensure a robust user experience:

- **WiFi Management**: The system is designed to create a single Access Point (AP) while simultaneously attempting to connect to multiple pre-defined station (STA) configurations, ensuring reliable connectivity.
- **Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates**: Support for OTA updates allows developers to flash new firmware versions over the network, eliminating the need for a physical USB connection once the device is deployed.
- **SPIFFS File System**: The project utilizes the Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System (SPIFFS) to store and serve compressed HTML pages and configuration files directly from the ESP8266's flash memory.
- **WebSockets & mDNS**: These protocols are used to provide real-time communication and easy device discovery on a local network without needing to track static IP addresses.

## Hardware and Prerequisites

The firmware is optimized for the ESP8266 NodeMCU. To build and deploy these firmwares, the following environment is required:
- Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 board core.
- The `arduinoWebSockets` library for real-time data handling.
- The `arduino-esp8266fs-plugin` for uploading web assets to the SPIFFS partition.

By combining direct hardware manipulation (for WoL) with standard IoT protocols like MQTT and WebSockets, this project provides a versatile foundation for DIY home automation enthusiasts looking to extend the capabilities of their networked environment.
