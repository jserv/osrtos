# OMOTE: The Open Source Universal Remote Firmware

OMOTE is a sophisticated firmware project designed for the ESP32, transforming it into a powerful, open-source universal remote control. By combining traditional infrared (IR) capabilities with modern wireless protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and MQTT, OMOTE serves as a bridge between legacy home entertainment systems and contemporary smart home ecosystems.

## A Multi-Protocol Control Hub

The core strength of the OMOTE firmware lies in its versatility. It is designed to handle a wide array of devices through different communication channels:

- **Infrared (IR):** Using the `IRremoteESP8266` library, it can decode and transmit IR signals to control televisions, amplifiers, and other traditional AV equipment.
- **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** By acting as a BLE keyboard (via the NimBLE stack), the remote can control modern media players like the Amazon Fire TV or Apple TV, which often lack IR receivers.
- **MQTT:** For smart home enthusiasts, OMOTE integrates with MQTT brokers to control lights, switches, and other IoT devices, making it a central interface for home automation.

## High-Performance Graphical Interface

OMOTE features a rich, touch-based user interface powered by the **LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)**. The UI is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, utilizing the `LovyanGFX` driver for high-speed display updates. 

One of the most innovative aspects of the project is its **cross-platform simulator**. Developers can compile and run the exact same LVGL-based UI on Windows, Linux, or macOS using PlatformIO and SDL2. This allows for rapid prototyping, layout adjustments, and logic testing without the need to constantly flash physical hardware.

## Hardware Evolution and Support

The firmware supports multiple generations of OMOTE hardware. Early revisions (Rev 1-4) utilize the standard ESP32-WROOM modules, while the latest Revision 5 and higher transition to the **ESP32-S3**. This upgrade provides significant performance benefits, including:

- **PSRAM Support:** Allowing for larger memory buffers for the GUI.
- **8-Bit Parallel LCD Interface:** For smoother animations and higher frame rates.
- **TCA8418 Keypad Controller:** Offloading button scanning to dedicated hardware.

## Development and Customization

Built with **PlatformIO**, the project is highly modular. Users can define their own device pools, mapping specific IR codes or MQTT topics to UI elements. The `platformio.ini` configuration is extensively documented, providing toggles for features like WiFi, Bluetooth, and various logging levels. 

Whether you are looking to replace a drawer full of remotes or build a custom smart home controller, OMOTE provides a robust, extensible foundation for embedded developers and DIY enthusiasts alike. Detailed guides on modifying the firmware and using the software simulator are available in the project's documentation.
