## Overview

The `_polimi_iot` repository is a dedicated space for projects developed as part of the Internet of Things (IoT) course at Politecnico di Milano. This repository acts as a central hub for students to upload and manage their coursework, showcasing various implementations and experiments conducted throughout the semester.

## Educational Focus

IoT courses at institutions like Politecnico di Milano typically bridge the gap between hardware and software. The projects hosted here are likely focused on the design and implementation of connected systems, covering topics such as:

- **Embedded system programming**: Developing firmware for microcontrollers and constrained devices.
- **Wireless sensor networks (WSN)**: Implementing communication between multiple nodes using low-power protocols.
- **Communication protocols**: Working with standards like MQTT, CoAP, or LoRaWAN for efficient data transfer.
- **Data collection and cloud integration**: Connecting physical devices to internet-based services for monitoring and analysis.

The repository structure, featuring a primary `_iot` directory, suggests a modular approach to organizing different assignments or project phases, allowing for a structured progression through the IoT stack.

## Technical Significance

For developers and students interested in the academic approach to IoT, this repository provides a glimpse into the curriculum and practical requirements of a leading technical university. While the specific hardware and software stacks may vary by project, the focus remains on solving real-world problems using modern IoT architectures and methodologies.

## Community and Learning

Repositories like this are essential for collaborative learning and version control in an academic environment. By hosting their IoT projects on GitHub, students at Politecnico di Milano not only manage their code effectively but also contribute to a broader ecosystem of open-source educational materials. This practice encourages transparency and allows for peer review and collective improvement of IoT solutions within the university community.
