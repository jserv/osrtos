## Overview

The Gpio_Driver_bbb project provides a specialized Linux character device driver tailored for the BeagleBone Black (BBB) platform. This driver serves as a bridge between the hardware GPIO pins and userspace applications, allowing for granular control over pin direction, logic states, and interrupt configurations. Developed as a kernel module, it leverages the standard Linux kernel abstractions while incorporating real-time considerations through the Xenomai framework.

## Driver Architecture

The heart of the driver is the per-device data structure, `bbb_gpio_dev`. This structure acts as a central repository for each instantiated GPIO pin, containing:
- A `cdev` kernel abstraction for character device operations.
- A `struct gpio` instance describing the specific pin configuration.
- State variables for logic levels (high/low) and direction (input/output).
- Boolean flags and counters for interrupt management.
- A spinlock to ensure synchronization during atomic operations.

The driver follows a standard lifecycle, beginning with an initialization routine that registers character device numbers, creates a device class in the `/sys` directory, and allocates memory for the device structures. It also claims specific GPIO resources (such as pins 48 and 49) and exposes them to userspace via device nodes in `/dev`.

## Key Features and Functionality

### Flexible GPIO Control
The driver supports a variety of commands through the standard `write` system call. Userspace applications can send string commands to the device nodes to reconfigure pins on the fly:
- `"out"` / `"in"`: Sets the pin direction.
- `"1"` / `"0"`: Sets the logic level high or low (for output pins).
- `"rising"` / `"falling"`: Configures edge-triggered interrupts.
- `"disable-irq"`: Disables interrupt processing for the pin.

### Interrupt Handling and Debouncing
One of the more advanced features of this driver is its experimental interrupt support. It includes an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) that tracks the number of requests and uses a custom `millis()` function—derived from `do_gettimeofday`—to implement software debouncing. By ignoring interrupts that occur within a 200ms window of the previous trigger, the driver ensures stability when connected to physical buttons or noisy signals.

### Synchronization
To prevent race conditions in a multi-process environment, the driver utilizes spinlocks (`spinlock_t`). These are particularly critical when modifying shared state variables or reconfiguring hardware registers during the `open`, `release`, and `write` operations.

## Testing and Usage

The repository includes dedicated test applications to verify driver functionality:
- **Output Test**: A utility that takes a logic level as an argument and applies it to the configured GPIO pins.
- **Input Test**: A program that sets pins to input mode, reads their current logic levels, and prints the results to the terminal.

### Example Command Usage
```c
// From userspace, setting a pin to output and high
int fd = open("/dev/bbbGpio49", O_WRONLY);
write(fd, "out", 3);
write(fd, "1", 1);
```

This driver provides a solid foundation for developers looking to interface with BeagleBone Black hardware at a low level, offering more control than standard Sysfs-based GPIO interactions while maintaining a familiar file-operation interface.
