title: MicroPython Stubs
summary: A collection of over 3,000 stub files for MicroPython that provide type hinting,
  auto-completion, and static type checking for embedded development. It supports
  numerous ports and boards, including ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico, and integrates
  with major IDEs to streamline the MicroPython coding workflow.

## Enhancing the MicroPython Development Experience

Developing for microcontrollers using MicroPython offers a high level of productivity, but it often lacks the robust tooling found in desktop Python environments. The MicroPython Stubs project bridges this gap by providing a massive repository of over 3,000 stub files (`.pyi`) generated specifically for the MicroPython ecosystem. These stubs act as "cheat sheets" for your code, providing the metadata necessary for modern IDEs to understand MicroPython's unique API and hardware-specific modules.

## Why Use Stubs for MicroPython?

In a standard Python environment, IDEs can often inspect source code to provide hints. However, MicroPython often runs on bare metal where the source code for built-in modules is compiled into the firmware and not easily accessible to a desktop editor. This project solves that by providing static type information that enables several key features:

- **Faster Coding**: With stubs, developers can write code more quickly and confidently. Function names, parameters, and return types appear automatically, eliminating the need to constantly reference external documentation.
- **Fewer Errors**: Stubs help catch mistakes early in the development cycle. If you provide incorrect arguments or call a non-existent method, your IDE will provide immediate feedback before you even flash the code to the board.
- **Context-Aware Completion**: The project provides stubs for specific boards and ports. This means your IDE can suggest board-specific features, such as specific pins or hardware peripherals unique to an ESP32 or a Raspberry Pi Pico.
- **Static Type Checking**: By adding typing information, tools like Pyright or Mypy can catch type-related bugs that would otherwise only surface as runtime issues on the device.

## Broad Hardware and Port Support

The repository contains stubs generated by the `MicroPython-Stubber` tool across a vast array of firmware versions, ports, and boards. Whether you are working with the `rp2` port for the Raspberry Pi Pico, the `esp32` port, or even the `unix` and `windows` ports of MicroPython, this project likely has the definitions you need. 

For developers curious about specific board differences, the project includes a **Stubs Explorer**, a web application written in MicroPython using PyScript that allows users to compare stubs across different hardware targets.

## Seamless IDE Integration

MicroPython Stubs are designed to work where you work. The project integrates with the most popular tools in the embedded space:

- **VSCode**: Works alongside extensions like MicroPico to simplify development for Raspberry Pi Pico boards.
- **PyCharm / IntelliJ**: Compatible with the MicroPython Tools plugin for JetBrains IDEs.
- **Thonny**: The popular beginner-friendly IDE has built-in support for these stubs starting with version 5.0 beta.

## Technical Implementation

The stubs are generated using a specialized toolchain. To build accurate stubs, the software often needs to run directly on the target hardware to inspect the available modules and their members. This ensures that the stubs reflect the actual capabilities of the firmware. The project utilizes `pyproject.toml` for configuration and supports modern Python tooling like `ruff` for linting and `pytest` for quality assurance of the generated stubs.

By providing a centralized, community-driven source for MicroPython type information, this project significantly lowers the barrier to entry for professional-grade embedded development using Python.
