title: Arduino CMSIS Module
summary: A specialized packaging project that adapts ARM's CMSIS 5 (Cortex Microcontroller
  Software Interface Standard) for use as an Arduino IDE module. It provides a structured
  build process for CMSIS-DSP math libraries and automated packaging scripts for Arduino
  board manager integration.

The Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for microcontrollers that are based on Arm Cortex processors. While CMSIS is a staple in professional embedded development, integrating it into the Arduino ecosystem can sometimes be a challenge. The **ArduinoModule-CMSIS** project by Forty Two Systems aims to bridge this gap by providing a streamlined way to package CMSIS 5.7.0 for the Arduino IDE.

### Bringing CMSIS to Arduino

This repository serves as a wrapper and packaging utility for the official CMSIS_5 distribution. Its primary goal is to take the complex structure of the CMSIS library—which includes core headers, DSP (Digital Signal Processing) functions, and RTOS implementations—and format it into a distributable package that the Arduino Board Manager can recognize. This allows developers to leverage high-performance math libraries and standardized hardware access within the familiar Arduino environment.

### Building the CMSIS-DSP Math Libraries

One of the most significant components of CMSIS is the DSP library. However, CMSIS_5 does not ship with prebuilt `.lib` or `.a` files. To use these features, developers must compile them for their specific architecture. The project provides a clear path for building these libraries using CMake.

To build the libraries, you need to create a `CMakeLists.txt` file within the `CMSIS_5/CMSIS/DSP` directory. The build process requires the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain and GnuWin32 (for Windows users). A typical build command looks like this:

```bash
cmake -DROOT="../../../../" \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="../gcc.cmake" \
      -DARM_CPU="cortex-m0plus" \
      -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe" \
      -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
```

Once configured, running `make VERBOSE=1` generates the static library files (`.a`) required for the math functions to work on the target hardware, such as the Cortex-M0+.

### Automated Packaging

After the math libraries are built, the project uses a `Makefile` to automate the creation of the Arduino module. By running `make all`, the system excludes unnecessary files (like version control metadata, documentation, and examples) to keep the package lightweight. It then compresses the `CMSIS_5` folder into a `.tar.bz2` archive and generates the necessary checksums and metadata for an Arduino `package_index.json` file.

### Technical Requirements

To successfully use this project to generate a module, you will need:
- **GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain**: Specifically tested with version 10 2020-q4-major.
- **CMake**: Version 3.14 or higher.
- **Build Tools**: Make (via GnuWin32 on Windows or native on Linux) and packaging tools like `tar` and `bzip2`.

This project is particularly useful for library authors and board support package (BSP) maintainers who want to provide their users with the full power of ARM's standardized software interface without forcing them to leave the Arduino ecosystem.
