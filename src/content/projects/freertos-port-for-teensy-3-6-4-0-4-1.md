## Overview

This project provides a robust port of the FreeRTOS real-time operating system for the Teensy 3.6, 4.0, and 4.1 development boards. While the Teensy platform is widely known for its high-performance ARM Cortex-M processors and Arduino compatibility, running a full RTOS kernel allows developers to manage complex, multi-tasking applications with deterministic timing and efficient resource management.

To achieve seamless integration, this port includes modifications to the Teensy Arduino core library. Specifically, it adjusts the `EventResponder` class to ensure that critical interrupt vectors like `SysTick` and `PendSV`—which are essential for FreeRTOS task switching—are handled correctly without breaking standard Arduino services. These services are effectively run on top of the RTOS, allowing for a hybrid development experience.

## Technical Implementation

The port is designed to work with a custom compiler toolchain and a modified Arduino core library. This setup enables support for modern C++ standards (such as C++20) and ensures that the RTOS kernel has the necessary hooks into the hardware's interrupt structure. 

One of the significant advantages of this implementation is the provision of thread-safe guards for the C standard library. Functions like `malloc` and `free` from newlib are protected, preventing memory corruption when multiple tasks attempt to allocate memory simultaneously. However, users should note that while the kernel and C-library are thread-safe, standard Teensy peripheral drivers (I2C, SPI, Serial) are not inherently thread-safe and require manual synchronization using FreeRTOS primitives like mutexes or semaphores.

## Key Features

- **Broad Hardware Support**: Compatible with Teensy 3.6 (Cortex-M4) and the high-performance Teensy 4.0/4.1 (Cortex-M7) boards.
- **Modern Toolchain Integration**: Optimized for use with PlatformIO and supports advanced C++ features.
- **Thread-Safe Memory**: Includes guards for newlib to ensure safe heap operations across tasks.
- **MISRA Compliance**: The underlying FreeRTOS kernel conforms to MISRA C:2012 guidelines, emphasizing safety and reliability in embedded applications.
- **Flexible Development**: Supports both PlatformIO and the standard Teensyduino/Arduino IDE environments.

## Usage and Development

For developers using PlatformIO, the project can be integrated by referencing the custom Teensy platform. This allows for a streamlined build process that automatically handles the modified core dependencies. Teensyduino users can also utilize the project by installing it as a standard ZIP library, though some advanced C++ features like `std::thread` may be limited by the default Arduino IDE compiler settings.

When developing for the Teensy 4.x series, the port includes specialized handlers for crash analysis. In the event of a system failure, the code is capable of printing useful stack traces and hard fault diagnostics, provided the appropriate compiler flags (like `-fasynchronous-unwind-tables`) are utilized. This makes it an excellent choice for experimental and complex firmware projects where debugging stability is paramount.
