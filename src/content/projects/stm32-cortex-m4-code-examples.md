## Overview

This repository serves as a practical reference for developers working with STM32 Cortex-M4 microcontrollers. It contains a diverse set of code examples originally developed through various professional embedded software courses and expanded with custom implementations for DMA and Digital Signal Processing (DSP). While many of these exercises were initially taught using Keil or OpenSystem Workbench, they have been ported and optimized for the STM32CubeIDE environment, making them highly accessible for modern development workflows.

## Hardware and Development Environment

The examples are designed to run on popular and affordable development boards, specifically the WeAct v1.3 STM32F411CEU6 (often referred to as the 'Black Pill') and the DevEBox STM32F407VGT6. The project utilizes a robust toolchain including:

- **STM32CubeIDE**: The primary integrated development environment.
- **CubeMX**: Used for MCU firmware configuration (FW_F4 V1.26.0).
- **SystemView**: Employed for real-time analysis and visualization of RTOS behavior.
- **Debugging Tools**: Support for JLink and STLink v2 (including modifications for SWO trace).

## Key Learning Areas

The repository is organized into specialized directories, each focusing on a critical aspect of embedded systems development:

### Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
Using FreeRTOS v202012.00, the projects demonstrate task management, synchronization primitives, and scheduling. These examples are particularly useful for developers looking to understand how to build responsive, multi-threaded applications on ARM Cortex-M hardware.

### Peripheral Interfacing and Protocols
Detailed implementations are provided for standard peripherals and communication protocols, including:
- **CAN Bus**: Controller Area Network communication.
- **DMA**: Direct Memory Access fundamentals and advanced programming to offload the CPU.
- **Timers and PWM**: Precise timing operations and Pulse Width Modulation for motor control or LED dimming.
- **USB and RTC**: Implementations for Universal Serial Bus and Real-Time Clock modules.

### Low-Level Development
For those interested in the 'under the hood' mechanics of the STM32, the repository includes:
- **ARM Assembler**: Ground-up assembly language exercises.
- **Custom Bootloaders**: Development of custom bootloader sequences for the STM32F4 series.
- **Sleep Modes**: Demonstrations of power management and sleep configurations.

## Technical Implementation

The projects leverage the STM32 HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) and LL (Low-Layer) drivers provided by STMicroelectronics. By providing the `.ioc` files (CubeMX configuration), the repository allows users to see exactly how clock trees, pin multiplexing, and peripheral parameters are configured before diving into the source code in the `Src` and `Inc` directories. This structure is ideal for students and engineers who want to bridge the gap between high-level configuration and low-level C implementation.
