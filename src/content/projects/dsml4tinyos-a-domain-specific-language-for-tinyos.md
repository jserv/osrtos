title: 'DSML4TinyOS: A Domain-Specific Language for TinyOS'
summary: DSML4TinyOS is a model-driven engineering framework for developing TinyOS
  applications using a graphical domain-specific language. It utilizes Eclipse EMF,
  Sirius, and Acceleo to enable visual modeling and automated nesC code generation,
  streamlining the development process for wireless sensor networks.

Developing applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) often involves navigating the complexities of TinyOS and its unique programming language, nesC. To address these challenges, **DSML4TinyOS** provides a model-driven round-trip engineering methodology designed to simplify the creation and management of TinyOS applications.

### The Core Concept
DSML4TinyOS (Domain-Specific Modeling Language for TinyOS) was developed as part of a master's thesis titled "A model-driven round-trip engineering methodology for TinyOS applications." The project aims to abstract the low-level complexities of nesC programming by allowing developers to work with high-level graphical models. These models represent the components, interfaces, and wiring logic that define a TinyOS application.

### Technical Architecture
The project is built upon the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and utilizes several powerful tools within the Eclipse ecosystem:

*   **EMF (Ecore):** The foundation of the project is a custom metamodel (`tinyos_metamodel.ecore`) that defines the structure and rules of TinyOS applications.
*   **Sirius:** This tool is used to create the graphical modeling workbench, allowing users to design their sensor network logic through visual diagrams rather than manual coding.
*   **Acceleo:** A template-based code generator that transforms the graphical models into valid nesC code (`.nc` files), including both configuration and module files.

### Automated Code Generation
One of the primary features of DSML4TinyOS is its ability to generate the boilerplate and structural code required for TinyOS. The repository includes examples of generated code, such as `MyProgramAppC.nc` and `MyProgramC.nc`. By automating the generation of component wiring and interface declarations, the framework reduces the likelihood of syntax errors and structural inconsistencies.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized into several Eclipse-based plugins:
*   **tinyos_metamodel:** Contains the Ecore metamodel and generated model code.
*   **tinyos_metamodel.edit & .editor:** Provides the UI components for interacting with the models.
*   **org.eclipse.acceleo.tinyos:** Houses the Acceleo templates responsible for the model-to-text transformation.
*   **Run/tinyos.design:** Contains the Sirius-based graphical representation definitions.

### Getting Started
As an Eclipse-based project, users typically import these plugins into an Eclipse IDE equipped with Modeling tools (EMF, Sirius, and Acceleo). Once the environment is set up, developers can create new TinyOS models, define their application logic visually, and trigger the generation tasks defined in the `generate.xml` files to produce the final nesC source code ready for deployment on sensor nodes.
