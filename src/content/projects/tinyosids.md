TinyOSIDS is a security-focused project providing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) specifically tailored for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Developed for the TinyOS environment, it addresses the unique security challenges faced by low-power, resource-constrained wireless devices typically found in sensor deployments.

## Overview

Wireless Sensor Networks are often deployed in open, remote, or hostile environments where they are susceptible to various network-layer attacks, such as sinkhole attacks, selective forwarding, or sybil attacks. TinyOSIDS provides a framework for monitoring network activity and identifying suspicious behavior that might indicate a compromise. Because these devices have limited processing power and memory, the IDS must be highly efficient and integrated deeply with the operating system's networking stack.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built to integrate with the TinyOS ecosystem, a component-based operating system designed specifically for low-power wireless devices. By leveraging the modular architecture of TinyOS and the NesC programming language, the IDS components can be integrated into existing sensor applications. 

The repository includes configuration for the TinyOS Eclipse plugin, which simplifies the development and build process. The build system is managed via a specialized Makefile that interfaces with the standard TinyOS `Makerules` system. This allows the project to be compiled for various hardware targets supported by TinyOS, such as MICAz or TelosB motes.

## Key Features

- **WSN Security Focus**: Specifically designed to handle the constraints and protocols of wireless sensor mesh networks.
- **TinyOS Integration**: Built as a set of components that fit into the TinyOS event-driven execution model.
- **Development Tooling**: Includes support for the TinyOS-Plugin for Eclipse, facilitating easier project management and compilation within a modern IDE environment.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Aimed at providing security monitoring without exhausting the limited battery and memory resources of sensor nodes.

## Getting Started

To use TinyOSIDS, developers typically need a working TinyOS environment. The project relies on the standard `TOSDIR` and `MAKERULES` environment variables to locate the core TinyOS files. The main logic resides within the `src` directory, where the NesC components define the detection logic and network monitoring hooks. Users can configure the build process through the provided Makefile, which is designed to work seamlessly with the Eclipse-based TinyOS development workflow.
