title: Arduino OSEK with Erika Enterprise (EE)
summary: This project provides a template and assignment for running OSEK/VDX-compliant
  applications on Arduino hardware using the Erika Enterprise v3 RTOS. It includes
  configuration files (OIL) and C++ source code designed for the RT-Druid development
  environment.

Developing real-time systems on Arduino often involves moving beyond the standard Arduino loop and into the world of formal Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The **ArduinoOSEK_EE** repository provides a practical foundation for developers looking to implement the OSEK/VDX standard on Arduino hardware using **Erika Enterprise v3**, a popular open-source RTOS for automotive and embedded applications.

### Bridging OSEK and Arduino

OSEK/VDX is a standard widely used in the automotive industry for real-time control. Erika Enterprise (EE) is one of the leading open-source implementations of this standard. This repository specifically targets the integration of EE with the Arduino platform, allowing developers to leverage OSEK's task management, resource management, and event-handling capabilities within the familiar Arduino hardware ecosystem.

The project is structured around the **RT-Druid** development environment, which is an Eclipse-based IDE specifically designed for configuring and building Erika Enterprise applications. 

### Technical Foundation: The OIL File

At the heart of any Erika Enterprise project is the **OIL (OSEK Implementation Language) file**. In this repository, you will find files like `conf.oil` within the `Example` and `OSEK_ASSIGNMENT` directories. These files define the system's static configuration, including:

- **CPU Architecture**: Defining the target (e.g., AVR for Arduino Uno/Mega).
- **Tasks**: Defining task priorities, stack sizes, and activation types.
- **Alarms and Counters**: Managing time-based events.
- **Resources**: Handling shared resources to prevent priority inversion.

### Getting Started with the Environment

Setting up a development environment for OSEK on Arduino is more involved than a standard Arduino IDE installation. The project documentation outlines a comprehensive Linux-based setup process:

1.  **Toolchain Installation**: You need the `avr-gcc` cross-compiler and the standard Arduino SDK to provide the underlying hardware abstraction.
2.  **RT-Druid & Erika Enterprise**: The core RTOS and its configuration tool must be downloaded from the official Erika Enterprise website.
3.  **System Dependencies**: Building the RTOS requires several utilities, including Java (for Eclipse/RT-Druid), Python, Flex, Bison, and CMake.
4.  **Hardware Access**: Proper permissions for serial communication (e.g., adding the user to the `dialout` group) are essential for flashing the compiled OSEK kernel to the Arduino board.

### Project Structure

The repository includes two main components:
- **Example**: A basic implementation showing how to structure a `code.cpp` and `tasks.cpp` file alongside the OIL configuration.
- **OSEK_ASSIGNMENT**: A more complex implementation likely intended for educational purposes, demonstrating task scheduling and system configuration in a more rigorous context.

### Why This Matters

For students and engineers, this project serves as a bridge between high-level application development and low-level real-time scheduling. By using Erika Enterprise on an Arduino, you can learn the complexities of deterministic scheduling and resource management without needing expensive automotive-grade hardware. It transforms a simple microcontroller into a powerful platform for learning industrial-standard RTOS concepts.
