## Overview

In many embedded applications, data needs to be buffered for later processing or transmission. While standard RAM-based circular buffers are common, they lose data on power failure and are limited by the microcontroller's volatile memory. The littlefs-ringbuffer library addresses these challenges by providing a circular data structure backed by the [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) filesystem.

By leveraging littlefs, this library allows developers to store large amounts of data in non-volatile flash memory while maintaining the efficient first-in, first-out (FIFO) behavior of a ring buffer. The implementation is designed with the same philosophy as littlefs itself: prioritizing memory efficiency and reliability in the face of power loss.

## Modes of Operation

The library is versatile, offering two distinct modes of operation to suit different data handling requirements:

### Stream Mode
In stream mode, the buffer treats all data as a contiguous sequence of bytes. This is ideal for logging raw sensor data, serial streams, or any application where the data is read back in the same linear fashion it was written. It provides a simple interface for appending and consuming bytes without worrying about boundaries.

### Object Mode
Object mode provides a more structured approach. The implementation dynamically partitions the buffer to store separate, variable-length objects. This is particularly useful for storing discrete messages, packets, or telemetry reports. Each object is treated as an independent unit, ensuring that you can retrieve complete records even if they vary in size.

## Technical Design

The library is intentionally lightweight, consisting of only a single header file and a single source file. This makes integration into existing embedded projects straightforward. 

**Key technical highlights include:**
- **Minimal Overhead:** The implementation adds only a few bytes of metadata on top of the standard littlefs data structures, ensuring that flash utilization remains high.
- **Reliability:** By building on littlefs, the ring buffer inherits power-loss resilience, ensuring that the buffer state remains consistent even if the system is interrupted during a write operation.
- **Efficiency:** The circular nature of the buffer ensures that old data is overwritten once the buffer is full, preventing filesystem exhaustion and providing a "set and forget" mechanism for continuous logging.

## Use Cases

This library is particularly well-suited for several common embedded scenarios:
- **Persistent Logging:** Storing system logs or error reports that must survive a reboot or power cycle.
- **Telemetry Buffering:** Storing sensor readings when a network connection (like LoRaWAN or Cellular) is unavailable, allowing for bulk transmission once connectivity is restored.
- **Large Data Handling:** Buffering data that exceeds the available RAM of the microcontroller by utilizing external SPI flash or internal flash memory.

Because it depends on littlefs, it is compatible with any platform where littlefs is ported, including popular RTOS environments like Zephyr, Mbed OS, and FreeRTOS, as well as bare-metal implementations.
