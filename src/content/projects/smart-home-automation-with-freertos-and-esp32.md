## Overview

Smart Home Automation is an advanced embedded systems project that moves beyond simple remote switching to create a truly intelligent environment. Built on the ESP32 microcontroller, the system leverages the power of FreeRTOS to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, ensuring real-time responsiveness for sensor monitoring, security alerts, and device control. The project integrates a variety of sensors and actuators to simulate a fully automated room, all managed wirelessly through a custom Android application.

## The Role of FreeRTOS

At the heart of this system is FreeRTOS, which allows the ESP32 to manage complex operations in parallel. Unlike traditional sequential loops, the RTOS architecture ensures that critical safety tasks—such as smoke detection or security alarms—can interrupt lower-priority tasks like updating the OLED display. This multitasking capability is what enables the system to maintain a constant Bluetooth connection while simultaneously processing sensor data and managing automated lighting and cooling.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The project is designed with a focus on three main pillars: monitoring, safety, and control.

### Activity Monitoring
Users can monitor the state of their home in real-time through two interfaces: a physical 0.96" OLED display connected via I2C and a dedicated Android app developed using MIT App Inventor. The system tracks temperature, humidity, light intensity, and security status.

### Safety and Security Systems
- **Smoke Detection:** An MQ2 sensor constantly monitors for hazardous gases. If smoke is detected, the system triggers an immediate audible alarm via a buzzer and a visual LED indicator.
- **Person Detection:** An ultrasonic sensor mounted at the door detects when someone is in range, notifying the user via the app and OLED display.
- **Touch Security:** Utilizing the ESP32's internal capacitive touch sensors, the system can detect when a door handle is touched, activating a security alarm that must be manually deactivated through the app.

### Intelligent Device Control
The system manages a fan and a bulb through a relay module, supporting three distinct operation modes:
- **Manual Mode:** Direct control via the Android app buttons.
- **Automatic Mode:** The system uses sensor thresholds to make decisions. For example, the fan activates when the temperature exceeds 33°C, and the lights turn on automatically when the LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) detects low ambient light.
- **Off Mode:** A master switch to power down all connected appliances instantly.

## Technical Implementation

The firmware is developed using the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 core. It utilizes several standard libraries to interface with hardware components:
- **DHT Sensor Library:** For reading temperature and humidity data.
- **Adafruit SSD1306 & GFX:** For driving the OLED display.
- **BluetoothSerial:** To leverage the ESP32's built-in Bluetooth capabilities for app communication.
- **Ticker:** For handling timed events without blocking the RTOS tasks.

## Hardware Components

The system is built around the ESP32 SoC and includes a comprehensive suite of peripherals:
- **Sensors:** DHT11 (Temp/Humidity), LDR (Light), MQ2 (Gas/Smoke), and HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic).
- **Outputs:** 5V Relay module, Active Buzzers, and various LEDs for status indication.
- **Display:** SSD1306 OLED.
- **Connectivity:** Built-in Bluetooth Classic for communication with the Android smartphone.

This project serves as an excellent example of how RTOS principles can be applied to consumer IoT devices to create more reliable and responsive automation systems.
