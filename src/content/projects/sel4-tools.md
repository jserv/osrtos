## Overview

The seL4 Tools repository serves as a foundational component of the seL4 microkernel ecosystem. Rather than providing the kernel itself, this project aggregates the necessary infrastructure to build, load, and maintain seL4-based systems. It acts as the primary toolkit for developers working with high-assurance embedded systems, ensuring that the complex build requirements of a microkernel-based architecture are handled consistently across different platforms.

## Core Components

The repository is organized into several specialized tools, each addressing a specific stage of the embedded development lifecycle:

### elfloader-tool
This is a critical component for ARM-based deployments. The elfloader is responsible for taking the seL4 kernel and the initial user-level boot task (the root task) and loading them into memory. It handles the transition from the bootloader environment to the kernel's execution environment, ensuring that the CPU state and memory layout are correctly prepared for the microkernel to take control.

### cmake-tool
Modern seL4 development relies heavily on CMake for configuration and build management. The `cmake-tool` directory contains the core logic for the seL4 build system. It provides the CMake modules and functions required to compile the kernel, manage dependencies between user-level libraries, and generate the final system images. This tool simplifies the process of targeting different hardware architectures and configurations by providing a standardized interface for system definition.

### Miscellaneous Utilities
Beyond building and loading, the repository includes a `misc` directory containing tools for project maintenance. This includes code style checkers and configuration filters that help maintain the high standards of code quality required for a verified microkernel project. These tools ensure that contributions adhere to the project's formatting standards, which is essential for long-term maintainability and readability.

## Technical Implementation

The project is designed to be integrated into larger seL4 projects as a dependency or submodule. By centralizing the build logic and loading tools, the seL4 project maintains a separation of concerns between the kernel source code and the infrastructure required to use it. 

**Key technical features include:**
- **Standardized Build System**: Uses CMake to provide a flexible and scalable build environment.
- **ARM Support**: Dedicated loading tools for ARM architectures, facilitating deployment on a wide range of embedded hardware.
- **License Compliance**: Adheres to REUSE standards and provides clear SPDX license identifiers, supporting its use in both open-source and commercial high-assurance environments.

## Getting Started

Developers typically interact with these tools indirectly through the seL4 project's build system. When setting up a new seL4 project, the `cmake-tool` logic is often invoked to configure the environment. For those working on ARM hardware, the `elfloader-tool` becomes a vital part of the image generation process. Detailed documentation for each specific tool can be found within their respective subdirectories in the repository, providing guidance on configuration options and integration steps.
