## Overview

The rpi01-xeno3 project provides a specialized real-time environment for the first generation of Raspberry Pi hardware, including the Pi 0, Pi 0-W, and Pi 1. By integrating Xenomai 3 with the Linux 4.1.21 kernel, this repository enables hard real-time capabilities on these compact ARMv6-based SoCs. Xenomai 3 operates as a co-kernel system, utilizing the I-pipe (Interrupt Pipeline) to manage real-time tasks with high precision and low latency, independent of the standard Linux scheduler.

## Technical Components

The repository is structured to support different levels of development needs, from kernel hackers to application developers:

*   **I-pipe Patched Kernel Source**: A complete Linux 4.1.21 kernel source tree already patched with the Adeos/I-pipe layer. This eliminates the often complex step of manually applying patches to the vanilla Raspberry Pi kernel.
*   **Build Infrastructure**: A dedicated set of scripts and guides for users who wish to compile the kernel from scratch. This is particularly useful for those needing to customize kernel configurations or add specific drivers while maintaining real-time performance.
*   **Pre-built Binaries**: For developers who want to jump straight into application development, the project includes a ready-to-use real-time kernel along with the necessary Xenomai user-space libraries and tools.

## Hardware Support

This project specifically targets the Broadcom BCM2835 SoC found in early Raspberry Pi models. While newer Pi models (like the Pi 3 or 4) often receive more attention, the Pi 0 and Pi 0-W remain popular for deeply embedded applications due to their small form factor and low power consumption. Implementing Xenomai on these devices allows them to handle time-critical tasks such as motor control, industrial protocol handling, or high-speed data acquisition that standard Raspbian/Raspberry Pi OS cannot reliably manage.

## Getting Started

Developers have two primary paths for utilizing this project. The first is the "Ready-to-Use" path, which involves downloading the pre-built kernel and user-space libraries. This allows for immediate deployment to an SD card. The second path is the "Build from Scratch" route, which utilizes the provided scripts to configure the cross-compilation environment, apply the I-pipe patches (if not using the pre-patched source), and compile the kernel for the ARMv6 architecture.

The inclusion of the Xenomai user-space libraries is critical, as they provide the APIs (such as the Alchemy skin) required to write C/C++ applications that leverage the real-time co-kernel. By providing both the kernel-side infrastructure and the user-side tooling, this repository serves as a comprehensive starting point for real-time Linux development on the Raspberry Pi 0 and 1 platforms.
