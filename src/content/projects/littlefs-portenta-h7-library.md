## Overview

The LittleFS_Portenta_H7 library is a specialized wrapper designed to facilitate the use of the LittleFS file system on the onboard flash of Arduino MBED Portenta_H7 boards. By leveraging the `ArduinoCore-mbed` core, this library provides a robust interface for developers needing reliable data storage on STM32H7-based hardware.

LittleFS is particularly well-suited for embedded systems because it is designed to be power-fail safe. This means that if the device loses power during a write operation, the file system remains in a consistent state, preventing data corruption—a critical feature for IoT and industrial applications.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The library acts as a bridge between the low-level flash hardware and high-level file operations. It supports both standard POSIX APIs (like `fopen`, `fwrite`, and `fread`) and the native mbed FileSystem APIs, giving developers flexibility in how they implement storage logic.

**Core capabilities include:**
- **Power-fail safety:** Protection against data loss during unexpected resets.
- **High performance:** Optimized for the specific constraints of flash memory.
- **POSIX Compatibility:** Easy porting of existing C/C++ code.
- **Debug Support:** Integrated logging with adjustable levels (0 to 4) to assist in troubleshooting file system operations.

## Hardware Support

This library is specifically tailored for the **Portenta_H7** series, including the Portenta_H7 Rev2 (ABX00042). It operates within the `ArduinoCore-mbed mbed_portenta` environment, ensuring compatibility with the dual-core architecture of the STM32H7 (M7 and M4 cores).

## Technical Implementation and Usage

Integrating LittleFS into a Portenta project is straightforward. The library handles the initialization of the FlashIAP (In-Application Programming) interface and mounts the file system automatically. 

### Example: File Access

The following snippet demonstrates how the library is typically used to perform basic file operations within the Arduino environment:

```cpp
#include "LittleFS_Portenta_H7.h"

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  while (!Serial);

  if (!LittleFS.begin()) {
    Serial.println("LittleFS Mount Failed");
    return;
  }

  FILE *f = fopen("/littlefs/test.txt", "w");
  if (f) {
    fprintf(f, "Hello from Portenta H7!");
    fclose(f);
    Serial.println("File written successfully");
  }
}
```

## Important Considerations

Users should be aware of a known limitation currently affecting the Portenta_H7 core. Testing has indicated that the file system may encounter issues when handling more than 8 files simultaneously. This behavior appears to be related to the underlying `ArduinoCore-mbed` implementation rather than the wrapper itself. Additionally, reducing the LittleFS partition size to 1024KB may further limit the reliable file count to 4. Developers should plan their storage architecture accordingly and check for core updates.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

To assist with development, the library includes a configurable debugging system. By defining `_LFS_LOGLEVEL_` before including the header, developers can output detailed internal state information to the Serial terminal. This is invaluable for verifying flash start addresses, partition sizes, and mount status during the initial setup phase of a project.
