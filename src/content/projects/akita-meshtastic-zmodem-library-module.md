The Akita Meshtastic ZModem project introduces a robust file transfer capability to the Meshtastic LoRa mesh ecosystem. While Meshtastic is primarily known for text messaging and location sharing, transferring binary files over high-latency, low-bandwidth LoRa links presents significant challenges. This project addresses those challenges by implementing a custom, non-blocking ZModem protocol engine specifically optimized for the Meshtastic environment.

At its core, the project offers two primary integration paths: a standalone Arduino library called `AkitaMeshZmodem` for custom firmware development, and a `ZmodemModule` designed to be compiled directly into the official Meshtastic firmware. This dual-approach ensures that both hobbyists building custom sensors and users of standard Meshtastic nodes can benefit from reliable file transfers.

### The ZModem Advantage

ZModem is a classic file transfer protocol known for its efficiency and reliability. Akita Engineering has modernized this by creating a "Zero External Dependency" implementation. The protocol stack is entirely built-in within the `src/utility/ZModemEngine`, eliminating the common headaches associated with finding and maintaining external ZModem libraries that might not be compatible with modern embedded environments like the ESP32.

One of the most critical features of this implementation is its non-blocking operation. In an RTOS-based environment like Meshtastic (which typically runs on FreeRTOS for ESP32 targets), blocking the main loop can lead to watchdog resets or missed network packets. The Akita ZModem engine is designed as a state machine that processes data in small chunks, ensuring the device remains responsive, continues to route mesh traffic, and manages its radio interface even during an active file transfer.

### Targeted and Efficient Transfers

Unlike standard Meshtastic messages that might be broadcast to all nodes, this library focuses on targeted, node-to-node transfers. By sending files directly to a specific Node ID, it minimizes unnecessary mesh congestion. The protocol utilizes simplified state handling and CRC checks optimized for 8-bit clean LoRa links, providing a balance between data integrity and protocol overhead.

To prevent interference with standard mesh operations, the system uses dedicated, configurable Meshtastic PortNums. By default, port 250 is used for command initiation, while a separate port handles the raw data transmission. This separation allows the module to listen for control commands (like "SEND" or "RECV") without being overwhelmed by the data stream itself.

### Hardware and Filesystem Compatibility

The library is primarily targeted at ESP32-based Meshtastic hardware, which provides the necessary flash memory and processing power to handle both the mesh stack and the file transfer engine. It is designed to be filesystem agnostic, leveraging the standard Arduino `FS` API. This means it works seamlessly with SPIFFS, LittleFS, or even external SD cards, depending on the hardware configuration.

### Integration and Usage

For developers using PlatformIO, adding the library is as simple as including the GitHub URL in the `lib_deps` section of the `platformio.ini` file. Once integrated, the engine requires a `begin()` call to initialize the transport streams and a `loop()` call within the main execution thread to drive the state machine.

Users interacting with a node running the ZModem module can initiate transfers via the Meshtastic CLI or other clients by sending text commands to the designated command port. For example, sending a command like `SEND:!a1b2c3d4:/test.txt` would instruct the node to begin transmitting a local file to a specific peer on the mesh. This project fills a significant gap in the Meshtastic ecosystem, providing a professional-grade tool for moving data across decentralized LoRa networks.
