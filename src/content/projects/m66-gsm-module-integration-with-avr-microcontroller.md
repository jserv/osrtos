Integrating cellular connectivity into embedded systems opens up a world of possibilities for remote monitoring and IoT applications. This project provides a robust framework for connecting the Quectel M66 GSM module with the ubiquitous ATmega328P microcontroller. By abstracting the complexities of AT commands and serial communication, it allows developers to focus on application logic rather than low-level protocol handling.

The M66 is a versatile quad-band GSM/GPRS module that supports voice, SMS, and data transfer. In this implementation, the module communicates with the AVR core via USART. The library includes essential routines for module initialization, signal quality assessment, and network registration checks. One of the standout features is the structured approach to SMS management, enabling both the transmission of messages and the detection of incoming alerts via the `+CMTI` notification.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The library is designed with reliability in mind, incorporating timeout management and response parsing to prevent system lockups during communication. Key functionalities include:

- **Automated Initialization**: The `M66_Init()` function handles the startup sequence and configuration, ensuring the module is ready for operation.
- **SMS Management**: High-level functions like `M66_SendSMS()` allow for sending messages to international numbers, while `M66_CheckSMS()` handles incoming message detection and parsing.
- **Direct AT Command Access**: For advanced users, `M66_SendAtCmd()` provides a direct interface to the module's command set with configurable timeouts and expected response matching.
- **Network Monitoring**: Built-in support for checking signal quality and network registration status.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using PlatformIO and VSCode, targeting the ATmega328P. It relies on an external USART library and a set of core macros for hardware abstraction. A critical requirement for stable operation is the configuration of the USART receive buffer; the library expects a buffer size of at least 340 bytes to accommodate long AT command responses and SMS content. Furthermore, the system utilizes an interrupt-driven approach, requiring global interrupts to be enabled for proper serial data handling.

## Example Usage

The following example demonstrates a typical setup where the module is initialized and then enters a loop to monitor for incoming SMS notifications.

```c
#include "aKaReZa.h"
#include "M66.h"

extern volatile bool usart_RxFlag;   
extern char usart_RxBuffer[__usart_RxBufferSize]; 

int main(void)
{
    // Initialize the M66 module
    if(M66_Init() != M66_Res_OK) 
    {
        while(1); // Handle initialization failure
    }
    
    // Send a boot notification SMS
    M66_SendSMS("+989123456789", "System Online");
    
    while(1) 
    {
        // Check if data has been received via USART
        if(usart_RxFlag)
        {
            // Look for the +CMTI notification indicating a new SMS
            if(strstr(usart_RxBuffer, "+CMTI") != NULL)
            {
                M66_CheckSMS();
            }
            else
            {
                usart_Flush();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

To integrate this library into a project, developers should ensure their hardware setup supports 115200 bps baud rate communication. The startup sequence can take up to 20 seconds as the module registers with the cellular network, so the software includes generous timeouts to account for network latency. Detailed API documentation is available in the repository, covering function parameters and return codes like `M66_Res_OK` and `M66_Res_TimeOut`.
