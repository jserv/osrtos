title: TinyOS Role for Ansible
summary: An Ansible role that automates the installation of the TinyOS operating system,
  the nesC compiler, and the MSP430 toolchain. It is designed to streamline the setup
  of development environments for wireless sensor networks, specifically targeting
  platforms like TelosB.

Setting up a development environment for wireless sensor networks (WSN) often involves juggling specific compiler versions, specialized languages like nesC, and hardware-specific toolchains. For developers working with **TinyOS**, an open-source operating system designed for low-power wireless devices, this process can be complex. The `ansible-role-tinyos` project provides a repeatable, automated way to provision a TinyOS environment using Ansible.

### What is TinyOS?

TinyOS is a component-based operating system and platform for wireless sensor networks. It is written in **nesC**, a dialect of the C programming language optimized for the memory and power constraints of sensor nodes. Because TinyOS development requires a specific toolchain—including the nesC compiler and microcontroller-specific tools—manual installation can lead to configuration errors or environment inconsistencies across a team.

### Automating the Toolchain Installation

This Ansible role automates the heavy lifting of environment preparation. It handles the installation of several critical components:

- **TinyOS**: The core operating system source code.
- **nesC**: The compiler required to build TinyOS applications.
- **MSP430 Toolchain**: The specific compiler and utilities for the MSP430 microcontroller, which is the heart of popular sensor nodes like the TelosB module.

Currently, the role is tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, providing a stable foundation for researchers and developers working with sensor hardware. It includes specific tasks for cloning the TinyOS and nesC repositories and configuring the build environment.

### Customizing Your Setup

One of the strengths of using Ansible is the ability to customize the installation via variables. This role allows you to define exactly where the source code should reside on your system. By default, it uses `/usr/local/src`, but this is easily overridden in your playbook:

```yaml
src_target: '/usr/local/src'
tinyos_src_dir: '{{ src_target }}/tinyos'
nesc_src_dir: '{{ src_target }}/nesc'
```

Beyond just installing binaries, the role also manages environment variables. It utilizes a template (`tinyos.sh.j2`) to ensure that your shell is correctly configured with the necessary paths (like `TOSROOT` and `TOSDIR`) to compile TinyOS applications immediately after the playbook runs.

### Getting Started

To use this role in your own infrastructure-as-code workflow, you can include it in a standard Ansible playbook. Here is an example of how to apply the role while changing the installation directory:

```yaml
- hosts: servers
  become: true

  roles:
     - { role: wedi.tinyos, src_target: ~/My/Working/Directory }
```

This approach ensures that every developer on a team or every node in a testbed has an identical, functional environment, significantly reducing the "time to first blink" for new sensor network projects.
