## Overview

The OCF My Light project is a practical implementation of a Smart Home Light device based on the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) standard. By leveraging the IoTivity framework, this sample provides a blueprint for developers looking to build interoperable IoT devices that can communicate across different platforms and network environments. 

The project is primarily designed to run on the **Samsung ARTIK 053 Starter Board** using the **TizenRT** (TinyARA-based) operating system. It also maintains compatibility with Linux (specifically Ubuntu 16.04), allowing for rapid prototyping and testing of virtual light resources before deploying to physical embedded hardware.

## Key Features

- **OCF Resource Model**: Implements standard light resources accessible via `/a/light/0` and `/a/light/1` URIs.
- **Dual Platform Support**: Native support for TizenRT on ARTIK hardware and a virtualized version for Linux.
- **IoTivity Integration**: Uses IoTivity 1.2.1 for TizenRT and IoTivity 1.3 for Linux, demonstrating the framework's cross-version capabilities.
- **Hardware Control**: On the ARTIK 053 board, the application directly controls two physical LEDs to reflect the state of the OCF resources.
- **TASH Integration**: For TizenRT users, the application integrates with the TizenRT Shell (TASH), allowing users to launch the OCF stack directly from the serial console.

## Technical Implementation

The project structure is modular, separating device logic, resource handling, and platform-specific porting. 

### Resource Handling
Core logic for the light resources is found in `ocf_mylight_light.c`. This file manages the state of the lights and handles OCF requests (GET, PUT, POST). The application uses the IoTivity C-SDK to register resources and define entity handlers that respond to network discovery and CRUDN operations.

### Platform Porting
A critical component for embedded deployment is `port_tinyara.c`. This file provides the necessary glue between the IoTivity stack and the TizenRT/TinyARA environment. It implements UUID generation, network interface discovery using `getifaddrs`, and mapping of IoTivity stack results to human-readable strings. It specifically interacts with the **lwIP** stack provided by TizenRT to manage network communication.

### Build Systems
The project supports two distinct build environments:
1. **TizenRT (Kconfig/Makefile)**: Integrated into the TizenRT build system, it uses `Kconfig` for feature selection and a standard `Makefile` for compilation within the TizenRT application directory.
2. **Linux (SCons)**: Uses the SCons build tool common in the IoTivity ecosystem, allowing the sample to be built as part of the IoTivity resource stack.

## Getting Started on TizenRT

To deploy this on an ARTIK 053 board, the project must be cloned into the TizenRT `apps/examples` directory. After configuring the build via `make menuconfig` to enable the "OCF My Light sample application," the resulting binary can be flashed to the board.

Once running, the device can be managed via the TASH console:

```sh
TASH> wifi join {SSID} {PASSWORD}
TASH> ifconfig wl1 dhcp
TASH> ocf_mylight
```

This sequence initializes the WiFi station, acquires an IP address via DHCP, and starts the OCF server. Once started, the light resources become discoverable by any OCF-compliant client on the same network.

## Security and Maintenance

The project includes hooks for OCF security and maintenance resources (`ocf_mylight_security.c` and `ocf_mylight_maintenance.c`). While the TizenRT version currently focuses on non-secured mode for simplicity in development, the Linux version supports secured builds using `mbedtls` and `tinycbor`. This provides a path for developers to implement Just-Works or Random PIN-based onboarding for their smart home devices.
