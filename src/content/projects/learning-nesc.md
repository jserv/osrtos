## Overview

nesC (networked embedded systems C) is a component-based, event-driven programming language used to build applications for the TinyOS platform. The Learn-nesC repository serves as an introductory guide and personal knowledge base for developers exploring the language's unique structure and its application in embedded systems, particularly wireless sensor networks.

As an extension of the C programming language, nesC is designed to handle the concurrency and resource constraints typical of low-power embedded devices. It introduces a component-based model where applications are built by "wiring" different components together through interfaces.

## Core Concepts and Syntax

nesC maintains a familiar C-like syntax, utilizing curly brackets and semicolons, but it shifts the focus from traditional procedural programming to a component-oriented architecture. Key features of the language include:

- **Interfaces**: These define the interaction between components. An interface declares a set of functions (commands) that a provider must implement and a set of events that a user must handle.
- **File Extensions**: nesC source files use the `*.nc` extension.
- **C Compatibility**: It supports standard C types and keywords such as `int`, `char`, `if`, `else`, and `#include` for header files.

### Basic Syntax Examples

In nesC, comments follow the standard C format:

```nesc
// This is a single line comment
/* This is
a multi-line
comment */
```

### Interfaces and Components

The `interface` keyword is central to nesC. It defines how different parts of an embedded application communicate. Below is a basic example of an interface definition:

```nesc
interface nescinterface() {
	printf("Welcome to my nesC program!\n");
	break
}
```

## Technical Implementation

The project includes a `makefile.mk` which suggests a build system based on GNU Make, commonly used in TinyOS development to compile nesC components into firmware for sensor nodes (often referred to as "motes"). The repository also explores basic logic and variable definitions within the nesC context:

```nesc
// If/Else statements in nesC
char s = "x is greater than y";
char t = "y is greater than x";
int x = 7;
int y = 10;
if x > y
	return s()
else
	return t()
```

## Embedded Context: TinyOS

nesC is inseparable from TinyOS, an open-source, BSD-licensed operating system designed for low-power wireless devices. TinyOS provides a library of components for common tasks like packet communication, routing, and sensing. Developers use nesC to write new components or wire existing ones together to form a complete embedded application. This repository documents the initial steps of understanding that ecosystem, from basic "Hello World" implementations to understanding the specialized keywords that make nesC unique in the world of RTOS development.
