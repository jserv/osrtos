title: TinyOS for MSP430
summary: A port of the TinyOS operating system specifically designed for small MSP430
  microcontrollers not officially supported by the main distribution. It enables development
  on various TI MSP430 families using modern GCC toolchains like TI MSP430-GCC.

TinyOS has long been a staple in the wireless sensor network (WSN) community, known for its component-based architecture and event-driven execution model. However, many smaller or newer MSP430 microcontrollers often fall outside the scope of official support. The tinyos-msp430 project bridges this gap, providing a dedicated port for electronics hobbyists and developers working with small-footprint TI MSP430 chips.

### Expanding Hardware Horizons

The primary goal of this project is to bring the power of TinyOS to a variety of MSP430 devices that are popular in the hobbyist community but missing from the main TinyOS production tree. Supported targets include several members of the MSP430F1xx, F2xx, and G2xx families. Specifically, it supports chips like the MSP430G2553 (found on the popular MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad) and the MSP430F2274 (used in the eZ430-RF2500T).

These chips typically feature modest resources—ranging from 4KB to 116KB of Flash and 256B to 10KB of RAM—making the lightweight nature of TinyOS a perfect fit for these constrained environments. The project also lists several "unconfirmed" targets that are expected to work, such as the MSP430F2418 and MSP430G2955.

### Modern Toolchain Integration

One of the standout features of this port is its support for modern compilation environments. While older TinyOS versions often relied on legacy toolchains that are difficult to install on modern operating systems, tinyos-msp430 supports:

- **TI MSP430-GCC**: Compatibility with the `msp430-elf` target and GCC 7.3.
- **Legacy mspgcc**: Support for the older `mspgcc4` (GCC 4.7) port.

This flexibility allows developers to use current development tools on Linux and macOS (via Homebrew or Linuxbrew) while maintaining the specialized execution environment required by TinyOS. The project even provides specific Homebrew taps to streamline the setup of the cross-compiler and the `mspdebug` stack.

### Component Support and Roadmap

The project includes a modified `tinyos-prod` tree tailored for these specific MCUs. While it already supports core functionality for many devices, there is an active roadmap to expand peripheral support. Current and planned features include:

- Support for ADC12, CRC16, and DMA on confirmed targets.
- Ongoing work for USI I2C Master and Bit-bang UART implementations.
- Future support for newer FRAM-based chips like the MSP430FR series (e.g., FR2311, FR5969) and LCD-enabled models.

### Getting Started

For developers looking to dive in, the project is best managed through the provided Homebrew/Linuxbrew taps, which simplify the installation of the necessary cross-compilers and debugging tools. By integrating with the standard TinyOS build system, users can compile their NesC applications for these previously unsupported chips just as they would for standard TinyOS platforms. The repository includes the necessary `tos` (TinyOS source) and `support` directories to get a project up and running on the target hardware.
