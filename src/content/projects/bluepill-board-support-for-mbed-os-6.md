## Overview

The BluePill board, based on the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, is one of the most popular and affordable ARM Cortex-M3 development platforms available. While Mbed OS provides extensive support for various STM32 targets, this project offers a dedicated, streamlined library to enable full compatibility with Mbed OS 6.12 and higher. It is designed to simplify the process of setting up a custom target for the BluePill within the modern Mbed build system.

## Hardware Support and Pin Mapping

This library provides comprehensive pin definitions and peripheral mappings for the STM32F103C8T6. By default, the project configures the following essential pins:

- **STDIO UART**: PA_2 (TX) and PA_3 (RX) for console communication.
- **Onboard LED**: PC_13, aliased as `LED1` for standard Mbed code compatibility.
- **Clock Configuration**: The target is configured to use the High-Speed External (HSE) crystal oscillator and the Low-Speed External (LSE) oscillator for the RTC when available.

Through the `PeripheralPins.c` and `PinNames.h` files, the library maps standard Mbed interfaces—including ADC, I2C, PWM, UART, SPI, and CAN—to the physical pins of the BluePill. This ensures that developers can use standard Mbed APIs like `PwmOut`, `I2C`, and `DigitalOut` without manual register configuration.

## Technical Implementation

The project is structured as a standard Mbed library, making it easy to include in existing projects via the Mbed CLI. It utilizes a `custom_targets.json` file to define the `BLUEPILL_F103C8` target, which inherits from the base `MCU_STM32F103x8` configuration. This inheritance allows the board to leverage the existing STM32 HAL while overriding specific parameters such as clock sources and ADC reference voltages.

Key configuration overrides include:
- `clock_source`: Set to use PLL with HSE or HSI.
- `rtc_clock_source`: Configured for LSE or LSI.
- `lse_available`: Enabled (1) to support the 32.768 kHz crystal often found on BluePill boards.

## Integration and Usage

Integrating this support into an Mbed OS 6 project involves adding the library and configuring the local environment. Once the library is added to the project root, the `custom_target.json` must be moved to the project folder to allow the Mbed build system to recognize the new board target. Developers can then set the target using the command `mbed target TARGET_BLUEPILL_F103C8` and proceed with standard compilation using the GCC_ARM toolchain.

For debugging and programming, the library supports standard hardware debuggers (such as ST-Link) and optional USB-to-Serial adapters for console output via the designated PA_2 and PA_3 pins. This setup provides a robust development environment for one of the most ubiquitous microcontrollers in the maker and professional embedded communities.
