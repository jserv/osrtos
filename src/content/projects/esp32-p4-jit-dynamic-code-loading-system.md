## Overview

ESP32-P4 JIT (P4-JIT) is a dynamic code loading framework designed specifically for the ESP32-P4 microcontroller. It bridges the gap between high-level Python development and low-level native performance by allowing developers to compile C, C++, or RISC-V assembly on a host PC and execute it natively on the target hardware in seconds. Unlike interpreted environments like MicroPython or virtual machines like WebAssembly, P4-JIT executes optimized machine code directly on the RISC-V core, providing maximum performance for compute-intensive tasks.

## Key Features & Capabilities

The system is designed to eliminate the traditional 30-60 second compile-flash-test cycle common in embedded development, replacing it with a 2-3 second deployment cycle. 

**Core capabilities include:**
- **Native RISC-V Performance**: Direct execution on the RV32IMAFC core with zero interpreter overhead.
- **Smart Arguments**: Automatic type conversion between Python/NumPy types and C types, including memory management for arrays.
- **Symbol Bridge**: The ability to call existing firmware functions (such as `printf`, `malloc`, or FreeRTOS APIs) directly from the dynamically loaded code.
- **Multi-File Support**: Automatic discovery and compilation of multiple source files with Link-Time Optimization (LTO).
- **High-Speed Transport**: Utilizes USB High-Speed (480 Mbps) via TinyUSB to achieve 10-12 MB/s throughput for code and data transfer.
- **Cache Coherency**: Automatic management of instruction and data caches to ensure safe execution of dynamically loaded code.

## Technical Architecture

P4-JIT follows a client-server architecture split between a host-side Python toolchain and a device-side ESP-IDF component. 

### Host Toolchain
The host side manages the build pipeline using the standard ESP-IDF RISC-V GCC toolchain. It performs a two-pass linking process: first, it queries the device for available memory; second, it generates a custom linker script to produce position-specific code for that exact memory address. It also includes a wrapper generator that creates the necessary C code to bridge Python arguments into RISC-V registers.

### Device Firmware
The device firmware is implemented as an ESP-IDF component. It runs a background FreeRTOS task that listens for commands over USB CDC-ACM. The firmware handles memory allocation (in both internal SRAM and PSRAM), writes the binary payload to memory, synchronizes the CPU caches, and executes the entry point. 

## Hardware Support

The project specifically targets the ESP32-P4, leveraging its unique features such as the **PIE (Processor Instruction Extensions)** for SIMD operations. This makes it particularly useful for testing custom ISA extensions that cannot be easily simulated in standard RISC-V environments like QEMU. It supports memory allocation across the device's 32MB of PSRAM and internal memory pools.

## Getting Started

Using P4-JIT involves writing standard C code and loading it via the `p4jit` Python library. Below is a basic example of the workflow:

```python
import numpy as np
from p4jit import P4JIT

# Define C source code
c_source = """
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
"""

# Initialize JIT system and load function
jit = P4JIT()
func = jit.load(source=c_source, function_name='add')

# Call natively on ESP32-P4
result = func(np.int32(10), np.int32(20))
print(f"Result: {result}") # Output: 30
```

For more complex scenarios, the system supports advanced features like bidirectional array synchronization, where modifications made to a NumPy array on the device are automatically reflected back on the host side. This is ideal for DSP prototyping, machine learning kernel optimization, and real-time audio processing.
