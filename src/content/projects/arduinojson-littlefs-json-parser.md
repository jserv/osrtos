## Managing JSON Data on ESP32 and ESP8266 with LittleFS

When developing for the ESP32 or ESP8266, storing configuration settings or complex data structures in JSON format is a common requirement. However, managing these files on the device's flash memory can be tricky. The `ArduinoJson_LittleFS_parse_json` project simplifies this process by providing a clear implementation path using the LittleFS filesystem and the popular ArduinoJson library.

### Why LittleFS?

LittleFS is a fail-safe filesystem designed for microcontrollers. It is particularly well-suited for SPI flash chips found on ESP modules, offering better performance and wear leveling compared to the older SPIFFS. This project focuses on reading `.txt` files containing JSON objects directly from this filesystem, allowing developers to keep configuration data separate from the application code.

### Getting Started with the Tools

One of the most helpful aspects of this repository is the inclusion of the `tools` folder. To upload files to your ESP device, you need a specific plugin for the Arduino IDE. The repository includes the latest versions of the LittleFS upload tools for both ESP32 and ESP8266 at the time of its creation.

To use them:
1. Download the `tools` folder from the repository.
2. Place it into your local Arduino directory.
3. This allows you to use the "ESP32/ESP8266 LittleFS Data Upload" option in the IDE to push the contents of your `data` folder to the device.

### Implementation Details

The project provides specific `.zip` files containing `.ino` sketches for both the ESP32 and ESP8266. A critical requirement for these sketches is that the `data` folder (containing your `json_text.txt`) must reside in the same directory as the `.ino` file for the upload tool to recognize it.

The core logic involves:
- Initializing the LittleFS filesystem.
- Opening the target JSON file from the flash memory.
- Using ArduinoJson to deserialize the file stream into a usable object.

### Performance Tip

The author includes a small but useful optimization tip for developers: if you find the execution speed lacking during certain operations, you might want to change `delay(1);` to `delayMicroseconds(10);` to reduce wait times without blocking the background processes of the ESP framework.

### External Resources

While the repository provides the necessary `.jar` files, you can always find the latest versions of the underlying plugins at their respective homes:
- **For ESP8266:** [arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-esp8266littlefs-plugin)
- **For ESP32:** [arduino-esp32littlefs-plugin](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32littlefs-plugin)

This project serves as an excellent boilerplate for any IoT application that needs to persist structured data across reboots using modern filesystem standards.
