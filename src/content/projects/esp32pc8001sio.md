The **Esp32PC8001SIO** project is a fascinating bridge between the late 1970s and modern IoT technology. Designed for the NEC PC-8001, one of Japan's most iconic early personal computers, this project provides a hardware and software solution to expand the machine's capabilities using an ESP32 microcontroller. By plugging into the PC-8001's SIO (Serial I/O) DIP16 socket, the ESP32 acts as a powerful co-processor, bringing SNTP time synchronization, environmental sensing, and modern file management to a 40-year-old system.

### Hardware Architecture
The project consists of two primary hardware components: an SIO "geta" (adapter) and a 2764 ROM adapter. The SIO adapter houses the ESP32-WROOM-32 and a BME280 sensor, interfacing with the PC-8001's serial port. Because the PC-8001 operates at 5V and the ESP32 at 3.3V, the design incorporates level shifters (MOSFET-based) and a 74LS04 inverter to ensure signal integrity. 

To handle the software side on the PC-8001, a custom 8KB ROM (using a 2764 EPROM) is installed in the machine's expansion socket. This ROM contains the Z80 assembly code required to interpret new "extended commands" and handle the XMODEM protocol for data transfers.

### Modern Features for a Vintage Machine
Once installed, the Esp32PC8001SIO transforms the user experience of the PC-8001:
- **SNTP Time Sync**: Automatically sets the PC-8001's internal clock using network time.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Using the onboard BME280, users can query temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure directly from the BASIC prompt.
- **FTP & SPIFFS Integration**: The ESP32 connects to a local WiFi network, allowing the PC-8001 to list and download files from a remote FTP server or the ESP32's internal SPIFFS storage.
- **High-Speed Loading**: While traditional cassette loading (CMT) is notoriously slow, this system supports 4800bps (PC-8001) or 9600bps (PC-8001mkII), using XMODEM for reliable binary transfers.

### Technical Implementation
The software stack is split between the ESP32 (written in C++ for the Arduino framework) and the PC-8001 (written in Z80 Assembly). The ESP32 manages the WiFi stack, FTP client, and sensor polling, while the Z80 code provides the user interface and low-level serial communication. 

One interesting technical detail is the use of the XMODEM SUM protocol (128-byte blocks) for transferring `.cmt` files. The system is intelligent enough to recognize whether a file is a BASIC program or machine code and will load it into the appropriate memory address automatically.

### Getting Started
To use the project, developers need to configure their WiFi and FTP credentials in `const.h` and apply a small patch to the `ESP32_FTPClient` library to ensure correct file listing behavior. 

```cpp
// Example configuration in const.h
const char * ssid     = "your_ssid";
const char * password = "your_password";
const char * ftpServer = "192.168.1.240";
```

On the PC-8001 side, the new functionality is accessed via the `cmd` (or `mat` on mkII) prefix. For example:
- `cmd sntp`: Sync the clock.
- `cmd bme`: Display sensor data.
- `cmd ftplist`: List files on the FTP server.
- `cmd ftpget,001`: Download the second file in the list.

### Community and Safety
The author emphasizes that this is a hobbyist project involving vintage hardware. Users are cautioned to check voltages carefully, as the SIO socket provides +12V and -12V rails that can easily damage modern components if shorted. Despite the risks, for those looking to breathe new life into a classic NEC machine, the Esp32PC8001SIO offers a robust and highly functional upgrade path.
