The **Crypto Implementations Example** repository serves as a focused educational resource for developers looking to integrate security features into their IoT applications using Contiki OS. Specifically designed for the Texas Instruments CC2650 SensorTag, this project bridges the gap between theoretical cryptography and practical implementation on resource-constrained hardware.

### Project Overview
At its core, the project utilizes the Contiki Operating System, a well-known open-source RTOS tailored for low-power microcontrollers and wireless communication. Contiki is widely used in commercial and non-commercial systems, such as industrial monitoring, smart street lighting, and radiation monitoring. By providing a pre-configured environment, this repository allows developers to jump straight into testing cryptographic routines without the overhead of setting up a complex build system from scratch.

### Technical Architecture
The repository is structured into two main components:
- **crypto_test**: This directory contains the application-specific logic, including the main `crypto_sample.c` file and the project configuration.
- **contiki-OS**: A full distribution of the Contiki OS source code, ensuring that all necessary drivers, network stacks (including IPv6), and system libraries are available locally.

The project targets the `srf06-cc26xx` platform, specifically the `sensortag/cc2650` board. The build system is managed via Makefiles that link the application code against the Contiki core libraries.

### Getting Started
To use this example, you will need the ARM GCC toolchain and the Srecord utility. The setup process involves adding the toolchain to your system path and using the provided Makefile to generate a binary.

```c
// Example of the project configuration in the Makefile
DEFINES+=PROJECT_CONF_H=\"project-conf.h\"
CONTIKI_PROJECT = crypto_sample
TARGET=srf06-cc26xx
BOARD=sensortag/cc2650

all: $(CONTIKI_PROJECT)

CONTIKI_WITH_IPV6 = 1
CONTIKI = ../contiki-OS
include $(CONTIKI)/Makefile.include
```

### Compilation and Deployment
1.  **Compile**: Navigate to the `crypto_test` directory and run `make`. This produces a `crypto_example.bin` file.
2.  **Flash**: Use the TI Uniflash tool to load the binary onto the TI CC2650.
3.  **Monitor**: Use `srecord` or a serial terminal to observe the output of the cryptographic tests.

### Why This Matters
In the world of IoT, security is often an afterthought due to the limited processing power of edge devices. This project demonstrates that even on tiny, low-power microcontrollers like the CC2650, it is possible to implement standardized cryptographic functions. It provides a template for developers to build secure, networked electrical power meters, alarm systems, and remote monitoring tools that require data integrity and confidentiality.
