title: Mbed OS LoRaWAN TinyShell Application
summary: A LoRaWAN example application for Mbed OS that integrates a command-line
  interface for real-time configuration. It supports both OTAA and ABP activation,
  provides NVM storage for provisioning data on MultiTech modules, and is compliant
  with the LoRaWAN v1.0.2 specification.

The Mbed OS LoRaWAN TinyShell project is a comprehensive example application designed to demonstrate the LoRaWAN protocol stack within the Mbed OS ecosystem. Compliant with the LoRaWAN v1.0.2 specification, this project provides a robust starting point for developers building long-range, low-power IoT applications using ARM-based microcontrollers.

### Integrated Command-Line Interface
One of the standout features of this repository is the inclusion of "TinyShell," a command-line utility that allows users to configure the device at runtime without re-flashing the firmware. Upon booting, the application provides a one-second window for users to enter command mode by pressing any key. This shell enables the configuration of:

- **Network Credentials**: Set Device EUI, Application EUI, and Application Key.
- **Operational Parameters**: Configure device class (Class A or C), data rates, and Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) settings.
- **Transmission Settings**: Adjust transmission intervals, port numbers, and retry counts for confirmed messages.
- **Persistence**: Save provisioning and application settings to non-volatile memory (NVM).

### Hardware and Radio Support
The application is designed to be portable across various Mbed-enabled hardware platforms. It includes specific support and target overrides in `mbed_app.json` for:

- **MultiTech mDot and xDot**: Includes support for filesystem-based NVM to read factory-provisioned EUIs and store user settings.
- **ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1**: Discovery kit featuring the muRata radio chip.
- **Mbed Enabled Radio Shields**: Compatible with SX1272 and SX1276 shields using the Arduino form factor on boards like the NXP K64F.
- **Advantech and RAK Modules**: Support for WISE-1510 and RAK811 modules.

### Configuration and Provisioning
Configuration is primarily managed through the `mbed_app.json` file, which defines the radio type, pin mappings, and default network settings. The project supports both Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) and Activation-By-Personalization (ABP). For regional compliance, the Mbed OS LoRaWAN stack allows for compile-time selection of various PHY layers, including EU868, US915, AU915, and AS923.

### Technical Architecture
The application utilizes the Mbed OS `EventQueue` to manage task execution and ISR deferment. This ensures that the LoRaWAN stack and application logic run efficiently within the same thread, which is particularly beneficial for memory-constrained devices as it minimizes stack usage and simplifies synchronization. The project also includes a `DummySensor` class to simulate data transmission, making it easy to test network connectivity immediately after setup.

### Getting Started
To deploy the application, users can import the project using the Mbed CLI. After configuring the `mbed_app.json` with the appropriate radio pins and network credentials, the project can be compiled for a specific target:

```sh
$ mbed import mbed-os-example-lorawan
$ cd mbed-os-example-lorawan
$ mbed compile -m YOUR_TARGET -t ARM
```

Once flashed, the device provides status updates via a serial console at 115200 baud, detailing the connection progress, ADR status, and the transmission of sensor data to the network server.
