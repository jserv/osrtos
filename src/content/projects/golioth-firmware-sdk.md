The Golioth Firmware SDK is a powerful middleware layer designed to bridge the gap between embedded hardware and the Golioth IoT cloud. It provides a standardized set of APIs that allow developers to implement complex IoT features—such as over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates, remote logging, and real-time data synchronization—without having to build the underlying communication protocols from scratch.

Built to be platform-agnostic, the SDK is designed for preemptive operating systems that provide an internet stack. It features first-class support for several major embedded ecosystems, including Zephyr RTOS, Espressif's ESP-IDF, and Infineon's ModusToolbox. It even includes experimental support for Linux, allowing for easier prototyping and testing on single-board computers.

## Core Services and Capabilities

The SDK organizes its functionality into several specialized services, each addressing a common requirement in IoT development:

- **LightDB State & Stream**: These services handle data persistence and time-series streaming. LightDB State allows for real-time synchronization of device state with the cloud, while Stream is optimized for high-frequency sensor data.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**: A robust firmware update module that supports multi-component updates, resumeable downloads, and rollback protection. It is designed to work with bootloaders like MCUboot.
- **Remote Logging**: Developers can send system logs directly to the Golioth console, making it significantly easier to debug devices deployed in the field.
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC) & Settings**: These modules allow the cloud to trigger specific functions on the device or update configuration parameters at runtime without requiring a reboot.
- **Location Service**: A newer addition that helps resolve Wi-Fi scan results and cellular tower information into approximate geolocation.

## Technical Architecture

Under the hood, the Golioth SDK utilizes efficient, industry-standard protocols. It primarily uses CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) over DTLS (Datagram Transport Layer Security) for secure, low-overhead communication. Data is typically serialized using CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), which provides a compact binary format ideal for resource-constrained microcontrollers.

The SDK is structured with a Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL), which simplifies the process of porting the SDK to new hardware or operating systems. This abstraction covers system-level requirements like thread management, semaphores, and networking sockets.

## Hardware and RTOS Integration

Golioth maintains a rigorous Continuous Integration (CI) system that verifies the SDK against a variety of hardware configurations. Verified boards include:

- **Espressif**: ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 (using both ESP-IDF and Zephyr)
- **Nordic Semiconductor**: nRF9160 DK (nRF Connect SDK) and nRF52840 DK
- **NXP**: FRDM-RW612
- **Infineon**: CY8CPROTO-062-4343W

For Zephyr users, the SDK integrates seamlessly with the `west` meta-tool, allowing it to be managed as a module within a Zephyr workspace. ESP-IDF users can include it as a component in their existing build system.

## Getting Started

The repository is organized to help developers get up and running quickly. The `examples` directory contains platform-specific applications ranging from a simple "Hello World" to complex OTA and sensor streaming demonstrations. The `golioth_basics` example is the recommended starting point for most users, as it demonstrates the core loop of connecting to the cloud and interacting with the primary Golioth services.
