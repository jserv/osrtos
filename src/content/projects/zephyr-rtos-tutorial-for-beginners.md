# Learning Zephyr RTOS: A Comprehensive Tutorial

Zephyr RTOS has emerged as one of the most significant open-source real-time operating systems for connected, resource-constrained devices. However, the learning curve for a modern RTOS can be steep. This tutorial project provides a structured, step-by-step path for developers to master Zephyr, moving from basic environment setup to complex synchronization primitives.

## Educational Approach

The tutorial is designed with a specific progression in mind, assuming the reader has a solid grasp of the C programming language and basic embedded electronics (like GPIO and timers) but no previous experience with real-time operating systems. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, ensuring that concepts like thread management and scheduling are understood before moving into hardware-specific interrupts or complex mutexes.

Most lessons conclude with practical exercises. These aren't just theoretical questions; they are hands-on tasks that demonstrate how the covered concepts apply to real-world embedded applications. Crucially, the repository includes solutions for these exercises, allowing learners to verify their work and understand best practices in Zephyr development.

## Core Curriculum

The tutorial covers the essential building blocks of any Zephyr-based application:

- **Environment Setup**: Detailed guides for configuring the Zephyr development environment on MacOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Fundamentals**: An introduction to RTOS basics and the specific architectural structure of the Zephyr project.
- **Thread Management**: Understanding how to define, spawn, and manage threads, which are the primary units of execution in Zephyr.
- **Hardware Interfacing**: Practical guides on using the GPIO API to interact with physical hardware.
- **Scheduling**: Deep dives into how the Zephyr kernel decides which thread runs next, including priority management.
- **System Services**: Lessons on using the logging subsystem for firmware telemetry and debugging techniques to troubleshoot embedded code.
- **Synchronization & Timing**: Advanced topics covering interrupts, hardware timers, and mutexes for thread-safe resource sharing.

## Practical Application

Beyond the core lessons, the project highlights the broader Zephyr ecosystem. Zephyr is used in a wide variety of professional projects, ranging from IoT cloud platforms like Golioth and mechanical keyboard firmware like ZMK, to complex systems like the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) and micro-ROS modules. By following this tutorial, developers gain the foundational skills required to contribute to or build upon these sophisticated open-source projects.

The tutorial is under active development and serves as a living document for the community. Whether you are a hobbyist looking to move beyond simple super-loops or a professional engineer transitioning to Zephyr, this guide provides the technical depth and practical examples necessary to become proficient in modern embedded RTOS development.
