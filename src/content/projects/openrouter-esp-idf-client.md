The OpenRouter ESP-IDF Client brings the power of modern Large Language Models to the ESP32 ecosystem. By providing a native C implementation for the OpenRouter API, this library allows developers to integrate sophisticated AI features—such as natural language processing and smart decision-making—directly into embedded firmware. It acts as a bridge to over 70 AI models, including GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, through a unified interface optimized for microcontrollers.

### Core Functionality

The library is built on the ESP-IDF framework (v5.0+), leveraging its networking and security components. It handles the complexities of TLS/SSL certificate validation and HTTP communication, ensuring secure connections to the OpenRouter backend. Key features include:

- **Chat Completions**: Full support for the OpenRouter chat API, allowing for structured and unstructured text interactions.
- **Real-time Streaming**: Token-by-token response handling, which is critical for creating responsive user interfaces on embedded displays or voice-interactive devices.
- **AI Function Calling**: A powerful feature that enables AI models to trigger specific C functions on the ESP32. This allows the AI to interact with hardware peripherals, such as toggling GPIOs or reading sensor data, based on natural language commands.
- **Multimodal Support**: Experimental support for processing images and audio, expanding the scope of AI applications to vision and sound-based tasks.

### Technical Design

Memory management is a primary concern in embedded systems. This client is designed with a memory-efficient architecture, allowing developers to tune response buffers and timeouts via the ESP-IDF `menuconfig` system. This ensures that the library can operate within the constraints of devices like the ESP32-S3 or C3, which may have limited available RAM compared to traditional computing environments.

The integration with `Kconfig` allows for easy adjustment of:
- **Response Buffer Size**: Defaulting to 4096 bytes, but adjustable based on the expected complexity of AI responses.
- **HTTP Timeouts**: Configurable for both standard and streaming requests to handle varying network latencies.
- **Model Parameters**: Runtime and compile-time settings for temperature, top-p sampling, and maximum token limits.

### Implementation Example

Setting up the client involves defining a configuration structure and creating a handle. The following example demonstrates a basic synchronous call to an AI model:

```c
#include "openrouter.h"

void app_main(void) {
    // Configure the client with API key and default model
    openrouter_config_t config = {
        .api_key = "your_api_key",
        .default_model = "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo",
        .response_buffer_size = 4096
    };
    
    // Initialize the handle
    openrouter_handle_t handle = openrouter_create(&config);
    char response[4096];
    
    // Execute a chat completion request
    esp_err_t err = openrouter_call(handle, "Explain the benefits of RTOS", 
                                   response, sizeof(response));
    
    if (err == ESP_OK) {
        printf("AI Response: %s\n", response);
    }
    
    // Clean up resources
    openrouter_destroy(handle);
}
```

### Hardware and Software Requirements

The library targets the ESP32 series of microcontrollers with at least 4MB of flash and 320KB of RAM. It requires a working Wi-Fi connection and an active OpenRouter API key. By utilizing the ESP-IDF component system, it integrates seamlessly into existing professional workflows, making it a robust choice for IoT developers looking to add intelligence to their edge devices.
