## Bringing eChronos to the STM32F4 Nucleo

The eChronos RTOS is a highly modular, formally verified real-time operating system originally developed by Data61 (CSIRO). While many embedded developers are familiar with mainstream options like FreeRTOS, eChronos offers a unique approach tailored for security-critical and safety-critical applications. The **echronos-on-STM32F4x-Nucleo-board** repository provides a practical example of this RTOS running on the popular STM32F4-Nucleo development platform.

### Why eChronos?

eChronos is designed for resource-constrained microcontrollers where high reliability is paramount. Its architecture allows for significant customization, enabling developers to include only the specific kernel components necessary for their application. This build-time configuration approach results in a minimal memory footprint and a reduced attack surface, making it an excellent choice for robust embedded systems.

### Hardware Target: STM32F4 Series

The project specifically targets the STM32F4 series of microcontrollers. Based on the ARM Cortex-M4 core, these MCUs are widely used in industrial, medical, and consumer electronics. By providing an example for the Nucleo board, this project makes it easier for developers to evaluate eChronos on standard, low-cost hardware before committing to custom PCB designs.

### Technical Implementation

This repository serves as a bridge between the core eChronos kernel and the STM32 hardware abstraction layer. It demonstrates how to:

*   Initialize the STM32F4 hardware to support the RTOS kernel.
*   Configure the eChronos scheduler for the Cortex-M4 architecture.
*   Manage tasks and system resources within the eChronos environment.

Typically, eChronos projects involve a toolchain that generates a specific kernel based on a system configuration file. This repository showcases the resulting integration, providing a clear path for developers to follow when porting the OS to similar STM32 hardware.

### Getting Started

For developers interested in exploring formally verified systems, this project offers a concrete entry point. By examining the implementation on the STM32F4-Nucleo, users can understand the interaction between the eChronos task manager and the underlying ARM hardware, providing a foundation for building more complex, high-assurance embedded applications.
