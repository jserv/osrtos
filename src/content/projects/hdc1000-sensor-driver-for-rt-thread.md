## Overview

The HDC1000 package is a dedicated sensor driver for the Texas Instruments (TI) HDC1000, an integrated humidity and temperature sensor. Designed to work seamlessly with the RT-Thread RTOS, this package allows developers to quickly integrate environmental sensing into their embedded projects. The HDC1000 is known for its excellent measurement accuracy and ultra-low power consumption, making it ideal for battery-powered IoT applications.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The driver provides full support for the HDC1000's primary sensing capabilities, including:

- **High Precision Sensing**: Measures temperature from -40°C to 125°C with ±0.2°C accuracy and relative humidity from 0% to 100% with ±3% accuracy.
- **Ultra-Low Power**: Optimized for efficiency, the sensor consumes an average of only 1.2µA when performing one measurement per second.
- **RT-Thread Sensor Framework**: Built upon the RT-Thread 4.0.0+ Sensor component, allowing the device to be accessed via standard device I/O APIs.
- **Communication Interface**: Uses the I2C (IIC) protocol for data communication, requiring the RT-Thread I2C driver framework.
- **Operational Modes**: Supports polling for data retrieval and includes built-in self-test functionality to ensure sensor integrity.

## Technical Implementation

The driver is structured to register two distinct sensor devices within the RT-Thread ecosystem: one for temperature (`temp_hdc1000`) and one for humidity (`humi_hdc1000`). This separation allows applications to interact with each sensing element independently using the standard `rt_device` interface.

### Initialization

To use the sensor, the driver must be initialized with a specific I2C bus name and configuration. The initialization function `rt_hw_hdc1000_init` handles device registration and hardware setup.

```c
#include "sensor_ti_hdc1000.h"

int rt_hw_hdc1000_port(void)
{
  struct rt_sensor_config cfg;
  rt_int8_t result;
  cfg.intf.dev_name = "i2c1";
  cfg.intf.user_data = (void *)HDC1000_ADDR_DEFAULT;
  cfg.irq_pin.pin = RT_PIN_NONE;
  result = rt_hw_hdc1000_init("hdc1000", &cfg);
  return result;
}
INIT_APP_EXPORT(rt_hw_hdc1000_port);
```

### Data Acquisition

Once registered, reading data from the sensor follows the standard RT-Thread pattern: find the device, open it, and read the sensor data structure.

```c
void application_get_sensor_val(void)
{
  struct rt_sensor_data sensor_data;
  rt_device_t dev = rt_device_find("temp_hdc1000");
  
  if (rt_device_open(dev, RT_DEVICE_FLAG_RDWR) == RT_EOK)
  {
      if (rt_device_read(dev, 0, &sensor_data, 1) == 1)
      {
          LOG_I("temp:%3d.%dC", sensor_data.data.temp / 10, sensor_data.data.temp % 10);
      }
      rt_device_close(dev);
  }
}
```

## Hardware Considerations

The HDC1000 is a robust choice for environmental monitoring, but for new hardware designs, the manufacturer recommends considering the HDC2010. While the HDC2010 offers improved features, it is important to note that it is not software-compatible with the HDC1000 registers, making this specific driver essential for existing HDC1000-based hardware platforms.
