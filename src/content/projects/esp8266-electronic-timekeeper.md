The ESP8266 Electronic Timekeeper is a specialized firmware project designed to transform an ESP8266 microcontroller into a network-accessible scheduling device. By combining the wireless capabilities of the ESP8266 with a robust local web server, the project provides an intuitive way to manage time-based events or periods without needing physical buttons or complex serial commands.

### Connectivity and Access

One of the core features of this project is its ease of access. The device operates as a WiFi access point, appearing in network lists as "timekeeper." Once connected using the default credentials, users can access the management dashboard simply by navigating to a local domain in a standard web browser. This eliminates the need for external cloud services, making the system entirely self-contained and private.

### Web-Based Management

The system features a comprehensive web interface that allows for real-time interaction with the device. The dashboard provides a clear overview of the current schedule. If a specific period has not been configured, the interface displays a "not set" status, ensuring the user always knows the state of the system.

Users can perform several administrative tasks through the browser:

- **Updating Periods**: The update page allows users to set specific times for different periods across the week. A notable feature is the ability to batch-update multiple periods before committing the changes to the device's memory.
- **Deleting Schedules**: If a scheduled period is no longer needed, the interface provides a simple deletion tool that resets the entry to its default state.
- **System Configuration**: Beyond scheduling, the web portal supports changing the access password and manually setting the system's internal date and time.

### Technical Implementation

Under the hood, the project relies on **LittleFS** for data persistence. LittleFS is a fail-safe filesystem designed specifically for microcontrollers, ensuring that the schedule and configuration settings remain intact even after power cycles or unexpected resets. This choice of filesystem is particularly well-suited for the ESP8266's flash memory, offering better wear leveling and performance compared to older alternatives like SPIFFS.

The integration of a web server directly on the ESP8266 allows the device to serve HTML content and handle HTTP POST requests for data updates. This architecture demonstrates an efficient use of the ESP8266's resources, balancing network handling with timekeeping logic. The project structure includes a dedicated directory for Bootstrap assets, indicating a focus on providing a responsive and modern user experience even on resource-constrained hardware.

### Getting Started

To deploy the timekeeper, the firmware must be flashed to an ESP8266 module. Once powered, the device initializes its WiFi Access Point and filesystem. Users can then connect their smartphone or computer to the "timekeeper" network and begin configuring their schedule. For those looking to customize the project, the repository includes the necessary assets for the UI and the core logic for time management.
