## Overview

The STM32H743ZI Playground is a specialized development environment for exploring the capabilities of the high-performance STM32H7 series using the Rust programming language. Specifically designed for the NUCLEO-H743ZI2 development board, this project demonstrates how to leverage Rust's safety and concurrency features in a demanding embedded context. 

At its core, the project integrates the Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) framework with a robust networking stack, providing a solid foundation for building responsive, network-enabled firmware. The use of Rust ensures memory safety and thread safety, which are critical when managing the complex memory architecture and high-speed peripherals of the STM32H7.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built upon a modern Rust embedded stack, featuring several key components:

- **RTIC (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency):** A concurrency framework for building real-time systems. It provides a prioritized task-based execution model that is highly efficient on Cortex-M hardware.
- **smoltcp:** A standalone, event-driven TCP/IP stack that is designed for bare-metal real-time systems. This project configures smoltcp with support for Ethernet, IPv4, IPv6, UDP, and TCP sockets.
- **stm32h7xx-hal:** The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides high-level APIs for interacting with the STM32H743's peripherals, including the Ethernet MAC, GPIOs, and clocks.

## Hardware and Memory Management

The STM32H743ZI is a powerhouse microcontroller featuring an ARM Cortex-M7 core. To handle its sophisticated memory map, the project includes a custom `memory.x` linker script. This script defines various memory regions including:

- **FLASH:** 2MB for program storage.
- **DTCM/RAM:** 128K of tightly coupled memory for data.
- **AXISRAM:** 512K of high-bandwidth RAM.
- **SRAM1-4:** Additional static RAM banks totaling over 350K.
- **ITCM:** Instruction Tightly Coupled Memory for performance-critical code.

This granular control over memory placement is essential for optimizing performance and managing DMA buffers, especially when using the Ethernet peripheral which often requires specific memory alignment and placement in AXISRAM.

## Development and Debugging

The repository includes a comprehensive set of configuration files for professional development workflows. It features an `ozone.jdebug` project file for the SEGGER Ozone debugger, allowing for high-level visual debugging. Additionally, J-Link reset scripts and custom flasher configurations are provided to streamline the development cycle. For logging, the project utilizes RTT (Real-Time Transfer) and ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell), enabling high-speed data output from the target device to the host machine without significantly impacting real-time performance.
