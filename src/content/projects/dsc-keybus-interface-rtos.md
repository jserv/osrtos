Modernizing a legacy home security system often requires expensive proprietary modules or cumbersome third-party bridges. The **dscKeybusInterface-RTOS** project changes that by providing a high-performance, open-source library that allows an ESP8266 to communicate directly with the DSC PowerSeries Keybus protocol. This repository is a port of the popular Arduino dscKeybusInterface library to the `esp-open-rtos` (FreeRTOS-based) environment, specifically optimized for native Apple HomeKit integration.

## Bridging the Gap Between Legacy and Smart Home

Many homes are equipped with DSC PowerSeries security systems (like the PC1832 or PC1555). While these systems are incredibly reliable, they lack modern connectivity. This library taps into the 12V Keybus data lines—the same lines used by physical keypads—to decode system states and even send commands back to the panel. By using the RTOS framework, the library achieves the precise timing required to capture asynchronous Keybus data without blocking other system tasks, such as WiFi or HomeKit encryption.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The interface provides comprehensive access to the security system's internal state:

- **Partition Monitoring**: Track armed, disarmed, alarm triggered, and entry/exit delay states across all partitions.
- **Zone Status**: Real-time monitoring of zones (open/closed) and zones currently in alarm.
- **System Health**: Monitor AC power status, battery levels, and system trouble codes.
- **Virtual Keypad**: Emulate a physical keypad to send keys (0-9, *, #) or specialized commands like arming (stay/away), fire alarms, and door chime toggles.
- **Native HomeKit Support**: Through the included HomeKit example, the system appears as a native Security System accessory in the iOS Home app, allowing for Siri control and automation without needing Homebridge or an external server.

## Hardware and Wiring

Because the DSC Keybus operates at approximately 12.6V, a simple voltage divider is required to interface with the 3.3V logic of the ESP8266. The project documentation provides clear wiring diagrams using common resistors (15k and 10k ohm) to safely bring the voltage down. For the virtual keypad functionality, a standard NPN transistor (like a 2N3904) is used to allow the ESP8266 to pull the Keybus data line low.

## Technical Architecture

The library is designed for reliability and performance. It utilizes pin change and timer interrupts to ensure accurate data capture. Because the DSC clock and data lines are asynchronous, the library uses a platform-specific timer interrupt to sample the data line exactly 250μs after a clock edge, preventing the timing errors that often plague simpler implementations.

### Example: Sending Keys to the Panel

The virtual keypad allows you to send commands to specific partitions. For example, to switch to partition 2 and enter a code:

```c
// Example logic for sending keys via serial or code
dscWritePartition = 2;
dscKeybusWrite("1234");
```

## Getting Started

The project is built using the `esp-open-sdk` and `esp-open-rtos` toolchains. Once the environment is configured, users can flash one of the provided examples:

1. **HomeKit**: The flagship example for direct iOS integration.
2. **Status**: A serial-based tool to monitor system changes and test virtual keypad commands.
3. **KeybusReader**: A diagnostic tool for raw protocol decoding and troubleshooting.

By leveraging the power of FreeRTOS on the ESP8266, dscKeybusInterface-RTOS provides a robust, low-cost (under $5 USD in components) solution for turning a traditional wired alarm into a fully integrated smart home component.
