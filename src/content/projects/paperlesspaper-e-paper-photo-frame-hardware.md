The Paperlesspaper project provides a comprehensive open-hardware solution for building a high-quality e-Paper photo frame. Unlike traditional monochrome or limited-color e-ink screens, this design leverages the Spectra 6 color EInk display, which offers a significantly broader and more vibrant color gamut, making it ideal for displaying digital art and photography in a physical frame.

### Hardware Architecture and Design

The repository is focused on the mechanical and electrical foundations of the device. The core of the design is a custom PCB (referred to as the "paper7" design) that interfaces with the EInk panel. The project provides the source files for the inner carrier—a sub-frame that acts as the structural backbone for the electronics. This carrier holds the PCB, the USB connector, and the battery compartment.

To ensure a professional finish, the project includes 3D-printable files for several critical components:
- **Battery Compartment**: A custom-designed holder for the power source.
- **Spacers and Distance Elements**: Ensuring the internal components are securely positioned within a standard picture frame.
- **USB Fixtures**: Mounting points for power and data connectivity.

### Manufacturing and Assembly

One of the standout features of this repository is the inclusion of specialized assembly jigs. Building an e-Paper frame requires precise alignment to ensure the display is perfectly centered and parallel within the frame's window. The project provides several specialized tools to assist in this process:

- **Passepartout Appliance Fixture**: A slim jig designed to align the display with a mat or passe-partout, ensuring the visible window is perfectly centered.
- **Display Appliance Fixture**: A bonding jig that holds the display panel in place while it is being adhered to the frame, preventing misalignment during the bonding process.

For the exterior, the design is intended to fit into a standard picture frame. The back panel is customized using laser-cutting or CNC milling, with source files provided in both Adobe Illustrator (.ai) and SVG formats. The color-coded vector files distinguish between cutting paths and marking paths, simplifying the fabrication process for users with access to a laser cutter.

### Technical Specifications

The project recommends using PETG for 3D-printed parts due to its durability and heat resistance. The mechanical design is optimized for assembly with minimal hardware; for instance, the battery compartment and spacers are designed to be used without screws, relying instead on precise fitment and basic adhesives where necessary. 

While this repository focuses on the hardware and CAD files, it serves as the physical platform for the Paperlesspaper ecosystem, enabling a low-power, aesthetically pleasing digital display that mimics the look of printed media through advanced EInk technology.
