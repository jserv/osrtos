title: 'ff_iso: STM32 Multitasking FATFS+SDIO'
summary: A thread-safe wrapper for FatFS and SDIO on STM32 microcontrollers using
  CMSIS-RTOS. It resolves concurrency issues by isolating file system operations into
  a dedicated high-priority task, allowing safe access from multiple application threads.

## Overview

Managing file system operations in a multitasking environment can be challenging, especially when dealing with SDIO and FatFS on STM32 microcontrollers. The `ff_iso` project provides a robust solution for isolating FatFS and SDIO operations, ensuring that multiple tasks can interact with the file system without causing race conditions or driver-level conflicts.

By creating a dedicated high-priority task to handle the core file system loop, `ff_iso` abstracts the complexity of reentrancy and timing requirements inherent in SD card communication. This approach is particularly useful for developers using STM32CubeMX and CMSIS-RTOS (FreeRTOS) who need reliable SD card access across various application threads.

## Key Features

- **Task Isolation**: Moves the heavy lifting of SDIO and FatFS management into a single, high-priority background task.
- **Thread Safety**: Solves common problems encountered when calling FatFS functions from different RTOS tasks.
- **Simplified API**: Provides straightforward initialization and loop functions that integrate easily into standard RTOS task structures.
- **STM32 Optimized**: Specifically designed for the STM32 ecosystem, leveraging standard HAL and CMSIS-RTOS primitives.

## Technical Implementation

The library works by separating the initialization and the operational loop of the file system. The developer creates a dedicated task (often called `StartTaskSD`) that initializes the library and runs an infinite loop calling `ff_loop()`. This task acts as the manager for the SDIO interface.

Other application tasks can then call standard file system operations like `ff_mount`, `ff_open`, and `ff_close` safely. The library handles the synchronization necessary to ensure these calls don't interfere with the underlying SDIO driver state.

## Getting Started

To use `ff_iso`, you need to set up two types of tasks. The first is the management task, which should be assigned a high priority to ensure the SDIO driver remains responsive.

```c
void StartTaskSD(void *argument)
{
  // Initialize the isolation layer
  ff_init();
  
  for(;;)
  {
    // Process file system events
    ff_loop();
    osDelay(1);
  }
}
```

The second type of task is your standard application logic. These tasks can perform file operations as needed without worrying about the low-level state of the SDIO peripheral.

```c
void StartTaskOther(void *argument)
{
  osDelay(100);
  
  // Standard FatFS-style operations
  ff_mount(....);
  ff_open(....);
  
  // Perform read/write operations
  
  ff_close(....);
  
  for(;;)
  {
    osDelay(1);
  }
}
```

This architecture ensures that the SDIO peripheral is managed consistently, even when the application logic becomes complex or involves multiple threads of execution.
