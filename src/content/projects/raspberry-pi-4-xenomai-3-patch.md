## Real-Time Linux on Raspberry Pi 4

The Raspberry Pi 4, powered by the Broadcom BCM2711 SoC, is a popular choice for embedded projects. However, standard Linux is not a real-time operating system (RTOS). For applications requiring deterministic response times—such as robotics, industrial control, or high-speed data acquisition—Xenomai provides a dual-kernel architecture that allows real-time tasks to run alongside the standard Linux kernel.

This project provides the necessary patches and documentation to port Xenomai 3 to the Raspberry Pi 4 using the Linux 4.19.86 kernel. It specifically addresses hardware-specific challenges, such as the USB controller's reliance on the PCIe bus, which often requires specialized handling in a real-time environment.

## The Interrupt Pipeline (I-pipe)

At the heart of this integration is the Interrupt Pipeline (I-pipe). The I-pipe is a kernel patch that introduces a high-priority execution stage for handling interrupts. By virtually turning device interrupts into NMIs (Non-Maskable Interrupts) from the perspective of the standard Linux kernel, it ensures that real-time tasks managed by Xenomai's Cobalt core are never delayed by standard kernel activities or interrupt masking.

The repository includes the `ipipe-core` patch tailored for the ARM architecture, which modifies the low-level interrupt handling, GPIO management, and timer systems to support this prioritized execution.

## Addressing Raspberry Pi 4 Specifics

Porting Xenomai to the RPi4 involves more than just applying a generic ARM patch. The RPi4 architecture introduced a PCIe-based USB controller that can cause kernel panics or driver failures when the interrupt management is altered for real-time use. 

This project includes specific patches to the `irq-bcm2835`, `irq-bcm2836`, and `pcie-brcmstb` drivers. These modifications ensure that the interrupt chips are marked as "pipeline safe" and that the PCIe controller uses the I-pipe's demultiplexed interrupt handling. This prevents the system from crashing when USB devices are connected or disconnected while the real-time kernel is active.

## Kernel Configuration for Real-Time Performance

Achieving low latency requires specific kernel configurations. The guide outlines several critical adjustments in `menuconfig`:

- **Timer Frequency**: Set to 1000Hz for high-resolution scheduling.
- **CPU Frequency Scaling**: Disabled to prevent the processor from changing clock speeds, which introduces jitter.
- **Memory Management**: Disabling memory compaction to avoid unpredictable delays during allocation.
- **Real-time Drivers**: Enabling Cobalt-specific drivers for GPIO and RTIPC (Real-Time Inter-Process Communication).

## Deployment and Validation

The project follows a structured build process involving cross-compilation on an Ubuntu host for the ARM target. Once the patched kernel and modules are installed on the Micro-SD card, users must also build and deploy the Xenomai user-space libraries. These libraries provide the API that applications use to interact with the real-time Cobalt core.

Validation is performed using standard Xenomai benchmarking tools:
- `xeno-test`: A comprehensive suite to verify the integrity of the real-time environment.
- `latency`: A tool to measure the scheduling jitter. If the latency tool starts and shows consistent, low-microsecond results, the real-time kernel is successfully operational.
