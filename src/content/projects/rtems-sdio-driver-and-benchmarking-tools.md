## Overview

This project represents the work completed during the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2018 for the RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) project. The primary objective was to port an SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) driver to RTEMS and develop a suite of benchmarking tools to evaluate its performance. 

RTEMS is a high-performance, open-source RTOS used extensively in space exploration, defense, and industrial control systems. Expanding its driver ecosystem to include SDIO is a significant step in supporting modern embedded hardware, as SDIO is a common interface for not only storage but also wireless modules like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

## The SDIO Driver Implementation

The core of this repository involves the integration of SDIO support into the RTEMS framework. SDIO is an extension of the SD card standard that allows the bus to be used for various I/O functions. By porting this driver, the project enables RTEMS to communicate with a wider range of peripherals that utilize the SDIO interface.

The work typically involves:
- Implementing the SDIO protocol state machine.
- Handling bus initialization and command/response sequences.
- Managing interrupt-driven I/O for efficient data transfer.
- Integrating the driver with the existing RTEMS filesystem or network stacks, depending on the peripheral type.

## Benchmarking and Performance Analysis

A critical component of this GSoC project was the development of benchmarking tools. In real-time systems, knowing the latency and throughput of a driver is essential for meeting hard real-time constraints. The benchmarking suite included in this repository allows developers to measure the efficiency of the SDIO stack under various conditions.

These tools help identify bottlenecks in the driver implementation, such as overhead in the interrupt service routines or delays in the command processing logic. By providing quantifiable data, the project ensures that the ported driver meets the high-performance standards expected by the RTEMS community.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the primary patches and source code developed during the GSoC period. The `patch` directory likely contains the modifications required to be applied to the main RTEMS source tree to enable the new functionality. This modular approach allows the RTEMS maintainers to review and integrate the work into the upstream project more easily.

## Impact on the RTEMS Ecosystem

By providing a functional SDIO driver and the means to test it, this project contributes to the overall maturity of the RTEMS hardware abstraction layer. It paves the way for better support for modern SoCs (System on Chips) that rely on SDIO for high-speed peripheral connectivity. For developers building embedded systems on RTEMS, this work reduces the barrier to entry when using hardware that requires SDIO-based communication.
