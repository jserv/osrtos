title: NuttX Development Docker Environment
summary: A Docker-based development environment for the NuttX RTOS. It provides a
  pre-configured Ubuntu container with all necessary toolchains and dependencies,
  including ARM cross-compilers and Kconfig tools, to build and run NuttX projects
  across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Streamlining NuttX Development with Docker

Setting up a development environment for a real-time operating system (RTOS) like NuttX can often be a complex task, involving the installation of specific cross-compilers, build tools, and configuration utilities. The NuttX Development Docker project simplifies this process by providing a containerized environment that encapsulates the entire toolchain, ensuring consistency across different host operating systems.

## A Complete Toolchain in a Box

The heart of this project is a carefully crafted `Dockerfile` based on Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal). It automates the installation of all essential components required for NuttX development, including:

- **Build Essentials**: Standard tools like `make`, `gcc`, and `g++`.
- **NuttX Specifics**: `kconfig-frontends`, `gperf`, and `genromfs` which are vital for configuring and building the NuttX kernel.
- **Cross-Compilation**: The `gcc-arm-none-eabi` toolchain, allowing developers to target ARM-based microcontrollers from their host machine.
- **Utilities**: Tools such as `bison`, `flex`, `texinfo`, and `u-boot-tools` to handle various stages of the build process.

By using Docker, the project eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem, providing a reproducible environment for every member of a development team.

## Cross-Platform Workflow

One of the primary advantages of this repository is its support for multiple host platforms. Whether you are working on Linux, macOS, or Windows, the project provides helper scripts to manage the container lifecycle. 

For Unix-like systems, `docker-setup.sh` provides simple commands to build the image and run the container. Windows users are supported via `docker-setup.bat`, which offers equivalent functionality. These scripts handle the complexities of volume mounting, ensuring that your source code resides on your host machine while being compiled inside the high-performance Linux container.

## Getting Started

The workflow is designed to be straightforward. After cloning the repository and initializing the NuttX submodules, users can build the environment with a single command:

```bash
source docker-setup.sh build
```

Once the image is ready, entering the development environment is as simple as:

```bash
source docker-setup.sh run
```

Inside the container, the user is placed in a dedicated workspace with sudo privileges and all tools pre-configured in the PATH. This allows for immediate execution of `make menuconfig` or `make` to begin the NuttX build process.

## Technical Implementation Details

The Docker configuration goes beyond just installing packages. It handles user permissions by mapping the host's UID and GID to the user inside the container, preventing common permission issues when writing files to the mounted source directory. It also sets up the locale and timezone to ensure that build timestamps and tool outputs are consistent with the developer's local environment.
