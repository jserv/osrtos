title: MultiFTPServer Library
summary: A lightweight FTP server library for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers,
  including ESP32, ESP8266, RP2040, and STM32. It enables remote file management—including
  uploads, downloads, and directory navigation—over standard FTP clients by interfacing
  with internal flash or external SD storage.

MultiFTPServer is a versatile and lightweight library designed to bring FTP server capabilities to a wide range of embedded platforms. By integrating this library into an Arduino-based project, developers can expose their device's filesystem to standard FTP clients like FileZilla, WinSCP, or Windows File Explorer. This allows for seamless remote file management, including uploading firmware updates, downloading logs, or managing configuration files without needing physical access to the device or its storage media.

## Broad Platform and Filesystem Support

One of the library's primary strengths is its broad compatibility across the modern embedded landscape. It is optimized for popular microcontrollers and supports a variety of storage backends:

- **ESP32 & ESP8266:** Full support for internal flash systems like SPIFFS, LittleFS, and FFAT, as well as external SD cards.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040):** Support for LittleFS and WiFi-based transfers.
- **STM32 & Wio Terminal:** Compatibility with SdFat and native FAT systems.
- **Arduino (AVR):** Basic support for SD cards using the 8.3 file format, though higher-performance boards are recommended for heavy use.

## Key Features and Capabilities

MultiFTPServer is more than a simple file transfer tool; it implements several advanced features that improve reliability and usability in embedded environments:

- **Concurrent Sessions:** The library can handle multiple simultaneous FTP connections, which is configurable via the `FTP_MAX_SESSIONS` definition.
- **Resume Support:** It supports the `REST` command, allowing interrupted file transfers to resume from where they left off, which is critical for large files over potentially unstable wireless connections.
- **UTF-8 Support:** Modern filename encoding is supported by default, ensuring compatibility with various operating systems and international characters.
- **Event Callbacks:** Version 3.0 introduced a robust callback system. Developers can register functions to trigger on connection events, file transfer starts, and free-space changes, allowing the application to react dynamically to FTP activity.

## Technical Implementation

The library follows a non-blocking polling pattern typical of Arduino middleware. Users initialize the server in the `setup()` function and call `handleFTP()` within the main `loop()`. This ensures that the FTP server processes incoming packets and manages state transitions without halting the rest of the application logic.

Configuration is centralized in `FtpServerKey.h`, where developers can tune buffer sizes (`FTP_BUF_SIZE`), timeouts, and debug output settings to match the RAM constraints of their specific hardware.

## Basic Usage Example

Setting up a basic server on an ESP32 is straightforward. After connecting to WiFi and mounting the desired filesystem, the server is started with a simple credential check:

```cpp
#include <WiFi.h>
#include <MultiFTPServer.h>

FtpServer ftpSrv;

void setup(){
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin("YOUR_SSID", "YOUR_PASS");
  
  // Wait for connection...
  
  // Mount your chosen filesystem
  // LittleFS.begin(); 

  // Start the server with username and password
  ftpSrv.begin("admin", "1234");
}

void loop(){
  // Must be called frequently to process FTP traffic
  ftpSrv.handleFTP();
}
```

## Ecosystem Integration

MultiFTPServer integrates well with the standard Arduino networking stack and is compatible with various network interfaces, including built-in WiFi and external Ethernet controllers like the W5500 or ENC28J60. Its small footprint makes it an ideal choice for IoT devices that require a standard interface for data retrieval or remote maintenance.
