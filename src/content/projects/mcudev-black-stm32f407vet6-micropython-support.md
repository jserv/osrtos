The MCUDev Black STM32F407VET6 is a popular and affordable development board featuring a powerful ARM Cortex-M4 processor. This project provides the essential board definition files to integrate this hardware into the MicroPython ecosystem, allowing developers to leverage Python for high-performance embedded applications.

### Hardware Overview

The heart of the board is the STM32F407VET6, running at 168MHz with 512KB of Flash and 192KB of SRAM. It is a feature-rich platform that includes:
* **Onboard Storage:** Winbond W25Q16 16Mbit SPI Flash and a Micro SD slot.
* **Connectivity:** 10/100 Ethernet MAC, dual CAN controllers, and USB 2.0 FS/HS support.
* **Expansion:** NRF24L01 socket, FMSC LCD interface, and a JTAG/SWD header for debugging.
* **User Interface:** Two user LEDs (PA6, PA7), two user buttons (PE3, PE4), and a Wakeup button.

### Getting Started with MicroPython

To use these definitions, you need to clone the repository into the MicroPython source tree. The build process follows the standard MicroPython port workflow for STM32:

```bash
cd micropython/ports/stm32/boards
git clone https://github.com/mcauser/BLACK_F407VE.git

cd ..
make BOARD=BLACK_F407VE
```

Once the firmware is built, flashing the board is straightforward using DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode. By setting the BOOT0 jumper to the ON position and connecting via USB, you can deploy the firmware directly:

```bash
make BOARD=BLACK_F407VE deploy
```

### Peripheral Mapping

The project provides detailed mappings for the board's extensive I/O. This includes the FSMC interface used for TFT displays (J1), the SPI configuration for the onboard Winbond Flash, and the SDIO pins for the Micro SD card. For wireless projects, the NRF24L01 socket is pre-mapped to specific pins (PB6 for CE, PB7 for CS, and PB8 for IRQ), making it easy to initialize communication modules in MicroPython scripts.

### Accessing the REPL

After deployment, the MicroPython REPL is accessible via the Micro USB port. This allows for interactive hardware control and rapid prototyping. You can connect using standard serial tools like `screen` or `minicom` at a baud rate of 115200. The board also supports the `pyb.bootloader()` command, which allows users to jump back into DFU mode for firmware updates without needing to toggle physical jumpers.
