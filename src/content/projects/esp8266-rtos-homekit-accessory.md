The ESP8266 RTOS HomeKit Accessory project is a technical implementation of Apple's HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP) designed to run natively on the ESP8266 microcontroller. By utilizing the `esp-open-rtos` environment—an open-source, FreeRTOS-based framework—this project allows developers to create HomeKit-compatible devices without the need for a software bridge or third-party hub.

## Native HomeKit Integration

Bringing HomeKit to the ESP8266 is a significant challenge due to the protocol's strict security and encryption standards. This project addresses these requirements by integrating several specialized cryptographic libraries. It handles the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, Type-Length-Value (TLV) encoding/decoding, and high-level security functions like SHA512 and Curve25519. 

The implementation relies on a combination of proven tools:
- **TweetNaCl**: Used for efficient cryptographic operations.
- **Nordic nRF51 HomeKit Library**: Adapted to handle the core HomeKit logic and SRP protocol.
- **mDNS**: Facilitates device discovery on the local network.

## Technical Challenges and Development

As a work-in-progress, the project provides a fascinating look into the resource constraints of embedded development. The ESP8266, while popular, faces significant memory and processing pressure when executing HomeKit's cryptographic handshakes. 

A key area of ongoing development involves managing the system's Watchdog Timer (WDT). During intensive calculations, such as the SRP `srp_setA()` function required in pairing step M4, the processor can become so occupied that it triggers a system reset. This requires careful task management and stack size optimization within the FreeRTOS environment to ensure stability during the pairing process.

## Current Progress

The project currently supports several critical milestones in the HomeKit lifecycle:
- mDNS TXT Discovery for network visibility.
- TLV encoding and decoding for structured data exchange.
- Successful execution of Pairing Steps M1 and M2.

### Example Pairing Output

The following debug log illustrates the communication flow during an initial pairing request, showing the transition through the M1 state:

```
[TCP] New client connected!
[TCP] Request received.
[DEBUG] Header have 119 bytes.
[DEBUG] Payload have 6 bytes.
0x00 0x01 0x00 0x06 0x01 0x01
[TLV] Tag received: Pairing method.
[TLV] Tag received: Pairing process (M1)!
[TCP] Writing payload with 409 bytes.
[TCP] Response sent!
[TCP] Client disconnected...
```

## Getting Started

For developers looking to explore native HomeKit on the ESP8266, the project is structured around a standard Makefile build system. It is designed to be compiled within the `esp-open-rtos` toolchain. The core logic is contained within `accessory.c`, which defines the accessory's identity and handles incoming TCP connections. Because this project is pushing the limits of the hardware, developers should be prepared to dive into memory management and task prioritization to expand upon the existing pairing implementation.
