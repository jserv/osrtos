# OBJEX Link: A Sustainable and Modular IoT Ecosystem

OBJEX Link is a modular IoT development platform that challenges the "disposable" nature of modern electronics. Designed with a core philosophy of sustainability, repairability, and recyclability, OBJEX Link provides a versatile hardware ecosystem for developers, researchers, and hobbyists to build long-lasting IoT solutions.

## The Modular Philosophy

At the heart of OBJEX Link is a two-part architecture: the mainboard and the interface modules. This separation of concerns allows for high levels of customization without the need to redesign the entire system for every new project. The mainboard provides the core processing power and connectivity, while specialized modules can be swapped in to provide specific sensors, actuators, or communication interfaces.

This design is not just about flexibility; it is a deliberate choice to combat electronic waste. By making components easy to access and replace, OBJEX Link ensures that devices can be repaired rather than discarded when a single component fails.

## Hardware Evolution and ESP32-C3 Support

The project has seen significant evolution through various iterations, from the initial v1.0 to the latest v1.6-C3. The inclusion of the ESP32-C3 (in the v1.6-C3 variant) brings modern RISC-V processing and integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 (LE) capabilities to the platform. This makes it an ideal choice for low-power IoT applications that require secure and robust connectivity.

The compact form factor of the board ensures it can be integrated into a wide variety of enclosures, including wearables and industrial monitoring equipment.

## Versatile Applications

OBJEX Link is designed to meet the demands of diverse sectors:
- **Smart Cities & Homes:** Automation, environmental monitoring, and energy management.
- **Industrial IoT (IIoT):** Predictive maintenance and factory floor data collection.
- **Agriculture:** Soil monitoring and automated irrigation systems.
- **Wearables:** Compact, low-power devices for health and activity tracking.
- **Robotics:** Rapid prototyping of sensor arrays and control logic.

## Open Hardware and Community

The project is licensed under the CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 (Weakly Reciprocal), emphasizing a commitment to open-source principles. This allows the community to study, modify, and improve the hardware designs. The repository includes comprehensive resources, including KiCad libraries, 3D models, and firmware examples, providing everything needed to start building or even manufacturing custom versions of the board.

For those looking to get started quickly, the project maintains detailed documentation and a shop for purchasing pre-assembled boards and modules.
