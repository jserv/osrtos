## Introduction to ARUW's RoboMaster OSS Submission

In the world of competitive robotics, the RoboMaster competition stands out as a high-stakes arena for engineering innovation. The Advanced Robotics at the University of Washington (ARUW) has been a significant contender in this space, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with custom-built robotic systems. This repository serves as the documentation hub for their Master Control Board (MCB) software, which was submitted for the prestigious 2020 RoboMaster Open Source Software (OSS) Award.

## The Brain of the Robot: The Master Control Board

The Master Control Board is the central nervous system of a RoboMaster robot. It is responsible for orchestrating a wide array of complex tasks, including chassis movement, gimbal stabilization, power management, and sensor fusion. For ARUW, the MCB software represents a sophisticated implementation of real-time control loops and communication protocols designed to operate reliably under the intense physical and computational pressure of a robotics match.

## A Resource for the Community

The primary purpose of this repository is to host the [wiki](https://github.com/MatthewMArnold/aruw-mcb-oss-award-wiki-2020/wiki) that explains the inner workings of their system. By participating in the OSS Award, ARUW contributes to the broader robotics community, allowing other teams and enthusiasts to learn from their architectural choices and implementation strategies. 

The documentation is designed to be a comprehensive guide, covering:
- **Software Architecture**: How the system is structured to handle concurrent tasks.
- **Control Logic**: The algorithms used to ensure precise movement and targeting.
- **Design Decisions**: The rationale behind specific engineering choices made during the 2020 season.

## Connecting Documentation to Code

While this repository focuses on the "why" and "how" through its extensive wiki, the actual implementation—the source code itself—is located in the [aruw-mcb](https://github.com/uw-advanced-robotics/aruw-mcb) repository. Together, these two resources provide a complete picture of a professional-grade robotics software stack. 

For developers interested in embedded systems, control theory, or competitive robotics, the ARUW MCB project offers a wealth of knowledge. It demonstrates how to build robust, real-time applications that must interface with a variety of hardware components while maintaining high performance and reliability.
