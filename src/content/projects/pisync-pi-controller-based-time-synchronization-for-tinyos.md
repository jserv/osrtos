## Overview

PiSync is a specialized implementation of clock synchronization for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), built specifically for the TinyOS operating system. Based on research published in *IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology*, this project implements an adaptive Proportional-Integral (PI) controller approach to synchronize the local clocks of distributed wireless nodes. 

In the context of WSNs, maintaining a common notion of time is critical for tasks such as coordinated sensing, communication scheduling (like TDMA), and data fusion. PiSync addresses the inherent challenges of clock drift and oscillator instability by applying control theory to the problem of clock synchronization.

## Technical Foundation

The core of PiSync is based on the paper "Adaptive Proportional-Integral Clock Synchronization in Wireless Sensor Networks." Unlike traditional synchronization methods that might simply reset a clock or use linear regression on a fixed window of samples, PiSync treats the synchronization error as a signal to be processed by a PI controller. 

This approach offers several advantages:
- **Stability**: The PI controller is designed to converge to a stable state even in the presence of network jitter.
- **Adaptivity**: The algorithm can adjust to changing environmental conditions that affect oscillator frequency, such as temperature fluctuations.
- **Precision**: By modeling both the phase (offset) and frequency (drift) of the clock, it achieves high-precision synchronization across the network.

## Implementation Details

PiSync is implemented using nesC, the component-based programming language used by TinyOS. The repository contains several key components that handle different aspects of the synchronization process:

- **TimeSyncP.nc & TimeSyncC.nc**: These form the core logic of the synchronization provider, implementing the PI control loop.
- **GlobalTime.nc**: Provides the interface for applications to access the synchronized global time.
- **TimeSyncDistP.nc**: Manages the distributed nature of the protocol, ensuring that synchronization information propagates through the network.
- **TimeSyncTopologyP.nc**: Handles the organization of nodes, which is vital for multi-hop synchronization scenarios.
- **TimeSyncMsg.h**: Defines the packet structures used for exchanging timing information between nodes.

The project supports different timing granularities, including microsecond-precision synchronization (`TimeSyncMicroC.nc`) and 32kHz-based synchronization (`TimeSync32kC.nc`), allowing developers to choose the power-to-precision trade-off that best fits their application.

## Architecture and Integration

As a TinyOS library, PiSync follows the standard asynchronous execution model of the OS. It uses interfaces and components to allow easy integration into existing sensor network applications. Developers can "wire" their application components to the `GlobalTime` interface provided by PiSync to obtain timestamps that are consistent across the entire deployment.

By leveraging the hardware-level timestamping capabilities often found in WSN radio chips (like the CC2420), PiSync minimizes the error introduced by the operating system's interrupt latency, ensuring that the input to the PI controller is as accurate as possible.

## Research and Applications

PiSync is particularly valuable for researchers and engineers working on high-performance wireless sensor applications where timing is critical. This includes seismic monitoring, industrial automation, and acoustic localization. Because it is based on peer-reviewed control-theoretic models, it provides a more mathematically rigorous foundation for synchronization than many ad-hoc protocols.
