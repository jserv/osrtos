## Overview

The Simple-App-using-CMSIS-lib project serves as a foundational repository for developers learning to program ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers using the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS). CMSIS is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer that provides a consistent software interface for processor cores and peripherals, making it easier to write portable and efficient code.

This project focuses on the "Hello World" of embedded systems: controlling LEDs. It provides two distinct methods for achieving LED manipulation, which are essential building blocks for more complex embedded firmware.

## Key Features

The repository contains two primary implementation styles for LED control:

- **Software Delay Blinking**: A straightforward implementation that uses software loops or system tick timers to create a pause between toggling the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. This is the most basic form of timing in embedded systems.
- **PWM-based Blinking**: A more advanced approach using Pulse Width Modulation. Instead of simply turning the LED on or off, this method allows for controlling the brightness of the LED or creating smooth "breathing" effects by varying the duty cycle of the signal sent to the pin.

## Technical Implementation

By utilizing the CMSIS library, the project interacts directly with the microcontroller's registers in a standardized way. This typically involves:

1. **Peripheral Clock Configuration**: Enabling the clock for the GPIO and Timer peripherals.
2. **GPIO Initialization**: Setting the specific pins connected to the LEDs as output pins (for standard blinking) or alternate function pins (for PWM).
3. **Timer Configuration**: For the PWM example, configuring the hardware timers to generate a specific frequency and duty cycle.
4. **Main Loop Logic**: Implementing the logic to either toggle pins or update timer compare registers to change the LED state.

## Getting Started

The project is organized into a `Blink` directory containing the source code. Developers looking to explore these examples would typically import the code into an IDE compatible with ARM development, such as Keil MDK, IAR Embedded Workbench, or an Eclipse-based environment like STM32CubeIDE. 

Because it uses CMSIS, the core logic remains highly portable across different silicon vendors (such as STMicroelectronics, NXP, or TI), provided the device-specific header files are included. These examples are ideal for students and engineers transitioning from high-level abstractions to more direct hardware control.
