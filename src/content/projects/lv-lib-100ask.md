## Overview

`lv_lib_100ask` is a versatile extension library for the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). It serves as a reference for out-of-the-box UI schemes and provides enhanced interfaces for various LVGL components. The project is designed to simplify the development of complex embedded user interfaces by providing pre-built modules that are commonly needed in IoT and handheld device projects.

## Key Components and Features

The library is modular, allowing developers to enable only the components they need through a configuration header. Some of the standout features include:

*   **Pinyin IME (Input Method Editor):** An enhanced interface for Chinese character input using Pinyin, which is essential for localized embedded applications.
*   **Page Manager:** A dedicated system for managing screen transitions, including support for custom animations and automatic memory management (deleting old pages to save RAM).
*   **Sketchpad:** A drawing board component built on top of the LVGL canvas, supporting customizable dimensions.
*   **File Explorer:** A reference implementation for navigating embedded file systems, featuring a quick access bar and path management.
*   **NES Simulator:** A game simulator module that allows running NES titles within an LVGL application, with platform-specific support for POSIX, FreeRTOS, and RT-Thread.
*   **Calculator and Games:** Includes a functional calculator component and classic games like 2048 and a memory puzzle game, serving as excellent references for application logic within LVGL.
*   **Screenshot Utility:** A tool to capture the current screen state, often used for debugging or documentation purposes.

## Technical Implementation

The project is highly portable and integrates seamlessly into various build systems. It includes a `CMakeLists.txt` for modern build environments (including specific support for the ESP-IDF platform), a `Kconfig` for kernel-style configuration, and a `library.properties` file for Arduino/PlatformIO compatibility. 

Configuration is handled similarly to LVGL itself. Users copy a template configuration file (`lv_lib_100ask_conf_template.h`) to their project root, rename it to `lv_lib_100ask_conf.h`, and enable the desired features. This approach ensures that the library remains lightweight by only compiling the code for active components.

## Platform Support

While the library is primarily RTOS-agnostic, it contains specific optimizations and configurations for:
*   **ESP32 (ESP-IDF):** Dedicated CMake logic and platform definitions.
*   **FreeRTOS & RT-Thread:** Specific platform hooks, particularly for the NES simulator.
*   **MicroPython:** Integration support for using these components within a MicroPython environment.

## Getting Started

To use `lv_lib_100ask`, the directory should be placed alongside the `lvgl` directory in your project. After setting up the `lv_lib_100ask_conf.h` file, you can initialize and use the components by including the main header:

```c
#include "lv_lib_100ask.h"

/* Example: Creating a simple 2048 game */
#if LV_USE_100ASK_2048
    lv_100ask_2048_simple_test();
#endif
```

The library is open-source and encourages community contributions to expand the collection of available UI schemes and components.
