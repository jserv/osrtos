## Overview

HomeIoT is a sophisticated project designed to simulate a complete Internet of Things (IoT) architecture for smart home automation. It provides a full-stack implementation ranging from low-power wireless sensor nodes to a cloud-based management application. The project leverages the power of Contiki-OS, a popular operating system for the Internet of Things, and utilizes the Cooja simulator to emulate a realistic wireless sensor network (WSN).

## System Architecture

The project is built upon an IPv6-based wireless sensor network. The architecture is divided into three main layers:

1.  **Sensor Nodes (Motes)**: These are the edge devices implemented in Contiki-OS. They represent various smart home components such as lightbulbs, PIR motion sensors, thermometers, heaters, and air conditioners.
2.  **Border Router**: A specialized node that acts as a gateway, connecting the low-power wireless network to the wider IPv6 network, allowing external applications to communicate with the motes.
3.  **Cloud Application**: A Java-based application that provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) and hosts smart services. It communicates with the sensor nodes using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP).

## Smart Devices and Services

HomeIoT emulates several common smart home devices, each with specific roles:
- **Bulb**: A controllable light source.
- **PIR**: A passive infrared sensor for motion detection.
- **Thermo**: A thermometer for environmental monitoring.
- **Heater & Air Conditioner**: Actuators used to regulate room temperature.

The system includes automated "Smart Services" that demonstrate the potential of interconnected IoT devices:
- **Smart Lights**: This service monitors PIR sensors; when motion is detected, it automatically triggers the corresponding lightbulb in that room.
- **Smart Temperature**: This service calculates the average temperature across multiple thermometers. If the temperature crosses predefined thresholds, it automatically activates the heaters or air conditioners to maintain a comfortable environment.

## Technical Implementation

The project uses the CoAP protocol to enable efficient communication between the resource-constrained motes and the cloud application. CoAP is specifically designed for M2M (Machine-to-Machine) applications and provides a request/response model similar to HTTP but with much lower overhead.

The cloud application is built using Java and Maven, providing a robust CLI for interacting with the network. Users can use commands like `ls` to list registered resources, `read` to check device status, and `set` to manually toggle devices or adjust settings.

## Simulation Environment

Because the project is designed for the Cooja simulator, it allows for rapid prototyping and testing of IoT logic without requiring physical hardware. The simulation environment handles the complexities of radio propagation and network topology, making it an excellent tool for studying WSN behavior and protocol interaction in a controlled setting.
