## Overview

The LVGL Offline Image Conversion Tool is a specialized Windows utility designed to streamline the process of preparing image assets for the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). While LVGL provides an official online converter, this tool offers a local, GUI-based alternative that eliminates dependency on web services and provides a more user-friendly interface than standard command-line tools.

## Core Functionality

At its heart, the tool is a wrapper around a PHP-based conversion engine (`img_conv_core.php`). It automates the transformation of common image formats like PNG, JPG, and BMP into the specific C-array structures or binary formats required by LVGL's image decoder. This is particularly useful for embedded developers who need to integrate custom icons, backgrounds, or UI elements into their firmware without relying on an internet connection.

## Key Features

- **Batch Conversion**: Users can process multiple images simultaneously. The tool automatically uses the original filenames as variable names in the generated C code, ensuring consistency between design assets and source code.
- **Comprehensive Color Format Support**: The tool supports a wide range of LVGL-compatible formats, including True Color (with or without alpha/chroma), Alpha-only (1, 2, 4, or 8-bit), and Indexed formats.
- **Dithering and Quality Control**: It includes logic for Floyd-Steinberg dithering to improve image quality on displays with lower color depths, such as RGB565 or RGB332.
- **Standalone Environment**: To ensure ease of use on Windows, the project bundles a minimal PHP environment (including `php.exe` and necessary DLLs like `php_gd2.dll`), so users do not need to install PHP manually.

## Technical Implementation

The conversion logic handles pixel-by-pixel processing, mapping standard RGB values to the target embedded color space. For C-array output, it generates a header and footer that define an `lv_img_dsc_t` structure, making the resulting file ready to be compiled directly into an LVGL project. 

### Example C Output Structure

When converting an image, the tool generates code similar to the following:

```c
#include "lvgl/lvgl.h"

const uint8_t my_image_map[] = {
  /* Pixel data in the selected format */
  0xff, 0x00, 0xee, ... 
};

const lv_img_dsc_t my_image = {
  .header.always_zero = 0,
  .header.w = 100,
  .header.h = 100,
  .data_size = 10000,
  .header.cf = LV_IMG_CF_TRUE_COLOR,
  .data = my_image_map,
};
```

## Handling Large Assets

One notable feature is the ability to tune the conversion environment via `php.ini`. For high-resolution images that might exceed default memory limits during processing, users can manually adjust the `memory_limit` parameter. This flexibility allows the tool to handle complex UI assets that might otherwise crash standard conversion scripts.

## Conclusion

This tool serves as a vital bridge for UI designers and embedded engineers, simplifying the asset pipeline for LVGL-based projects. By providing an offline, batch-capable interface, it ensures that development can continue smoothly even without internet access or when dealing with large volumes of graphical assets.
