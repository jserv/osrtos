title: LVGL Layout Preview
summary: A real-time layout preview tool for the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics
  Library). It supports both LVGL v7 container layouts and LVGL v8 flexbox layouts,
  providing a visual way to understand and debug embedded UI positioning.

## Overview

Designing user interfaces for embedded systems can be a challenging process, especially when dealing with complex layouts on small screens. `lv_layout_preview` is a utility designed to simplify this process for developers using the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). By providing a real-time preview of layouts, it allows developers to visualize how UI elements interact and align, significantly reducing the trial-and-error phase of UI development.

## Support for Multiple LVGL Versions

The project addresses the evolution of LVGL by providing support for two major versions of the library, each featuring different layout paradigms. This is particularly useful for teams maintaining legacy codebases while also developing new projects on the latest LVGL releases.

### LVGL v7: Container Layouts
In LVGL version 7, layouts were primarily managed using the `cont` (container) object. This system relied on specific layout properties to align children. The `lv_layout_preview_v7` module helps users understand the legacy container system, which was the standard before the introduction of more modern layout engines.

### LVGL v8: Flexbox and Grid
With the release of LVGL version 8, the library introduced more modern layout engines inspired by web standards, most notably Flexbox. The `lv_layout_preview_v8` component allows developers to experiment with flex-grow, flex-wrap, and alignment properties in real-time. This is crucial for mastering the more flexible but complex v8 positioning system, which behaves differently than the older container-based approach.

## Why Real-Time Preview Matters

In embedded development, the "compile-flash-test" cycle can be slow and tedious. A layout previewer significantly speeds up UI development by:
- **Reducing Hardware Iteration**: Minimizing the need for constant hardware flashing just to check if a button is centered correctly.
- **Immediate Visual Feedback**: Providing instant results when tweaking padding, margins, or alignment properties.
- **Educational Value**: Helping beginners understand the nuances of LVGL's layout engines through visual experimentation.

## Technical Implementation

The repository is structured into two main directories: `lv_layout_preview_v7` and `lv_layout_preview_v8`. This separation ensures compatibility with the specific API changes between the two versions. The tool is designed to be integrated into development environments or simulators, allowing developers to tweak UI parameters dynamically and see the results immediately on their screen.

Whether you are working with legacy LVGL v7 projects or modern LVGL v8 applications, this tool serves as a valuable bridge between code and visual design, ensuring that the final embedded interface looks exactly as intended.
