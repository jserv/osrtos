Bloom is a minimalist blogging engine designed for humans who value speed and simplicity. Built using the Nim programming language and the Jester web framework, Bloom aims to provide a high-performance web experience without the overhead of traditional CMS platforms. It is uniquely packaged as a single executable, making deployment as simple as running a binary.

### Core Philosophy and Features
The project is built on the principle of minimalism, with the core logic spanning fewer than 300 lines of Nim code. Despite its small footprint, it offers a robust set of features for modern blogging:

- **High Performance:** Powered by Jester, one of the fastest web frameworks in the Nim ecosystem.
- **Zero Configuration Database:** Uses a serverless SQLite backend, meaning there is no need to install or manage external database services like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- **Web-Based Administration:** Includes a built-in admin console for managing posts and configurations directly through the browser.
- **Developer Friendly:** The source code is extensively commented, making it an excellent reference for developers looking to learn Nim or Jester.
- **Configurable Security:** Supports configurable superuser credentials for secure administrative access.

### Technical Architecture
Bloom's architecture is divided into a clean directory structure that separates logic, data, and presentation. The core logic resides in the `src` directory, with `database.nim` handling SQLite interactions and `blog.nim` managing the application flow. The presentation layer uses a `views` directory containing templates for the blog front-end, single post views, login pages, and upload interfaces.

The project also includes a `createDatabase.nim` utility to initialize the SQLite schema, ensuring that the environment is ready for use immediately after compilation. The use of Nim's static typing and efficient compilation results in a fast, memory-efficient server that can run on minimal hardware.

### Getting Started with Bloom
Building Bloom from source is straightforward for anyone with the Nim compiler installed. To compile and run the server on `localhost:5000`, you can use the following command:

```bash
nim c -r index.nim
```

Before running the main application, users typically need to initialize the database using the provided creation script. The repository also includes a `configuration.json` file for managing site-specific settings and a `Procfile` for easy deployment to platforms like Heroku.

### Community and Contribution
Bloom is an open-source project licensed under MIT. The maintainer encourages community involvement, whether through opening issues to discuss major changes or submitting pull requests for improvements. With its small codebase and clear structure, it serves as a great starting point for developers looking to build or customize their own lightweight web applications.
