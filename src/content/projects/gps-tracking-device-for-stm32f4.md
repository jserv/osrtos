## Overview

This project implements a GPS tracking system built on the STMicroelectronics STM32F4 platform. Specifically targeting the STM32F411E-DISCO (Discovery) board, the application integrates satellite positioning data with a local user interface and is designed for future expansion into remote tracking via SMS. 

The system is built using a bare-metal approach, leveraging the STM32 Standard Peripheral Drivers and the CMSIS (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) to interact directly with the ARM Cortex-M4 hardware. 

## Hardware Integration

The project is designed around several key hardware components:
- **STM32F411E-DISCO**: The core development board featuring an STM32F411VET6 microcontroller with 512KB of Flash and 128KB of RAM.
- **GPS Module**: Connected via serial communication to provide real-time coordinates, altitude, and timing information.
- **LCD Display**: Interfaced via the I2C bus, providing a local readout of the current GPS status and coordinates.
- **SMS Module (Planned)**: Future integration for sending location data over cellular networks.

## Technical Implementation

The firmware is structured to handle peripheral initialization and data processing for the various modules. The use of the STM32 Standard Peripheral Library suggests a focus on direct register-level control and efficient resource usage. 

Key technical aspects include:
- **I2C Communication**: Used for driving the LCD display, allowing for a low-pin-count interface to the user.
- **UART/Serial Interface**: Utilized for capturing NMEA sentences from the GPS module.
- **Memory Management**: The project includes a custom linker script (`LinkerScript.ld`) generated by Ac6 System Workbench, which defines the memory layout for the 512KB ROM and 128KB RAM available on the target MCU.
- **Deployment**: A shell script (`flash_hex.sh`) is provided to streamline the flashing process using `st-flash`, targeting the standard 0x8000000 start address for STM32 flash memory.

## Development Status

This project is currently a work in progress. While the core GPS acquisition and LCD display logic are the primary focus, the interface for the SMS module is listed as a pending task. This will eventually allow the device to function as a remote tracker, capable of reporting its position to a mobile phone or server via standard text messaging.
