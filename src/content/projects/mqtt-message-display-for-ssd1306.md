The `mongoose-mqtt-ssd1306` project is a specialized firmware implementation for ESP8266 microcontrollers, designed to bridge MQTT network messages with physical OLED displays. Built on the Mongoose OS framework, it provides a streamlined way to visualize data from home automation systems or external controllers like Node-Red, specifically tailored for use cases like Pomodoro timers.

## Core Functionality

The application subscribes to specific MQTT topics and renders the received payload onto an SSD1306-based OLED display. It supports two primary modes of operation for data ingestion:

- **Plain Text**: Sending a simple string to the configured topic (default `status/tablo`) displays up to 5 characters, ideal for short status codes or countdowns.
- **JSON Payloads**: For more complex layouts, the project accepts JSON objects via `status/tablo/json`. This allows users to specify multiple lines of text and control the font size dynamically using a structure like `{"msg":"line 1\nline 2","msgSize":2}`.

## Technical Architecture

The project leverages the modular nature of Mongoose OS. By utilizing the `arduino-adafruit-ssd1306` library and the built-in I2C support, it handles the low-level display driving while the MQTT library manages the network communication. The project is primarily configured via a `mos.yml` file, which defines the hardware abstraction layer and software dependencies.

Key configuration parameters include:
- **I2C Pin Assignments**: Defaulting to GPIO 4 (SDA) and GPIO 5 (SCL), compatible with Wemos D1 Mini pinouts.
- **MQTT Connectivity**: Robust reconnection logic with configurable timeouts.
- **Font Scaling**: A mapping system that translates `msgSize` values into specific line counts (ranging from 1 large line to 8 small lines).

## Hardware Integration

Targeting the ESP8266 platform, the wiring is minimal. The SSD1306 display connects via the I2C bus. The project is designed to be flashed and configured using the `mos` tool, which allows for seamless WiFi and MQTT credential setup without modifying the source code directly. This makes it highly portable across different ESP8266 development boards.

## Use Cases

While originally developed as a Pomodoro timer display for Node-Red, the project's flexible JSON interface makes it suitable for various IoT applications, such as:
- Real-time sensor data monitoring
- Notification tickers for smart home events
- Network status displays
- Simple desktop clocks or weather stations

The integration with Mongoose OS ensures that features like OTA (Over-the-Air) updates and RPC-based configuration are available, making it a production-ready starting point for small display-based IoT nodes.
