Digital filtering is a crucial component in embedded systems for processing sensor data and overcoming random interference. The rtt-libfilter library provides a collection of digital filter algorithms specifically optimized for the RT-Thread ecosystem.

One of the primary advantages of using digital filtering over analog hardware filters is the lack of additional hardware costs. By implementing filtering as a computational process, developers can avoid impedance matching issues and achieve high reliability. Digital filters are particularly effective for signals with very low frequencies, which are often difficult to handle with traditional analog components.

## Supported Algorithms

The library provides several popular filtering techniques used to clean up noisy sensor data:

- **Kalman Filter**: A powerful recursive filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy measurements.
- **Mean Filter**: A fundamental smoothing technique that calculates the arithmetic average of a window of data points.
- **Savitzky-Golay (S-G) Filter**: A digital filter that can be applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of smoothing the data, that is, to increase the precision of the data without distorting the signal tendency.

In addition to these core implementations, the project addresses common microcontroller filtering needs such as limit filtering, median filtering, and weighted average filtering, which are essential for mitigating low-frequency interference and random signal noise.

## Technical Integration

As a library designed for RT-Thread, rtt-libfilter integrates seamlessly into the RT-Thread build system. It utilizes `SConscript` files to manage source code and include paths, allowing developers to easily add it to their projects via the RT-Thread package manager. The library is structured with a clear separation between headers in the `inc` directory and source files in the `src` directory.

The build configuration allows for optional inclusion of sample code, making it easier for developers to understand how to implement the filters in their own applications. By using the `PKG_USING_LIBFILTER` definition, the library can be conditionally compiled into the firmware image.

## Benefits for Embedded Development

Using software-based filtering through rtt-libfilter offers several benefits for embedded developers:

- **Resource Efficiency**: Multiple input channels can share a single filtering routine, reducing system overhead compared to discrete hardware components.
- **Flexibility**: Filtering characteristics can be adjusted by simply modifying the software parameters or algorithms without changing hardware layouts.
- **Reliability**: Software algorithms do not suffer from component aging, tolerance variations, or environmental drift that affects analog filters.
