The IoTConnect Azure RTOS SDK is a specialized development kit designed to facilitate the integration of embedded devices with Avnet’s IoTConnect cloud platform. By leveraging the industrial-grade capabilities of Microsoft Azure RTOS (formerly ThreadX), this SDK provides a robust foundation for building secure, scalable, and efficient IoT applications across a diverse range of hardware architectures.

### Multi-Platform Hardware Support
One of the standout features of this SDK is its extensive support for popular development boards and microcontrollers. It includes pre-configured samples and build instructions for a variety of ecosystems:
- **STMicroelectronics**: STM32L4+ and STM32U5 IoT Discovery Kits.
- **NXP**: MaaxBoard RT and MIMXRT1060 EVK.
- **Microchip**: SAM E54 Xplained Pro and the WFI32-IoT (EV36W50A) board.
- **Renesas**: CK-RX65N Cloud Kit and the original RX65N Cloud Kit.

This broad support ensures that developers can evaluate IoTConnect on their preferred silicon while benefiting from a consistent API and middleware stack.

### Secure Connectivity and Authentication
Security is a core pillar of the SDK. It supports multiple authentication methods to suit different production requirements, including X.509 Mutual Authentication and Symmetric Key support. For boards like the WFI32-IoT, the SDK integrates with the built-in ATECC608 secure element to handle device identity and cryptographic operations securely. The documentation provides detailed guides on generating self-signed certificates and using ECC or RSA keys depending on the hardware's processing capabilities.

### Integrated Middleware and Libraries
The project is structured to work seamlessly with the Azure RTOS ecosystem. It utilizes submodules such as `iotc-c-lib` for core IoTConnect logic, `cJSON` for data parsing, and `libTO` for security operations. For boards like the WFI32-IoT, the SDK implements a user-friendly configuration system where the device appears as a Mass Storage Device (MSD) on a PC. Users can simply edit `CLOUD.CFG` and `WIFI.CFG` files to provision the device without needing to recompile the entire firmware.

### Development Environment
The SDK is designed to be used with the native IDEs provided by silicon vendors, ensuring a familiar workflow for embedded engineers:
- **STM32CubeIDE** for ST boards.
- **MCUXpresso IDE** for NXP targets.
- **MPLAB X IDE** for Microchip devices.
- **e2 Studio** for Renesas RX microcontrollers.

A `setup-project.sh` script is provided to automate the initial repository configuration, making it easier to manage dependencies and submodules across different operating systems, including Windows via WSL or MSYS2.

### Advanced Features and IoT Capabilities
Beyond basic telemetry, the SDK includes samples for advanced IoT scenarios. The STM32L4 and WFI32-IoT samples demonstrate how to interface with various sensors (such as Click Boards) and transmit environmental data to the cloud. Additionally, support for Over-the-Air (OTA) updates is highlighted for platforms like the SAM E54, enabling remote firmware management and long-term device maintenance. The SDK serves as a bridge between high-performance embedded hardware and cloud-based device management, providing the necessary tools to move from prototype to production-ready IoT solutions.
