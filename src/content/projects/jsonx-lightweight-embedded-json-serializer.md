## Overview

JsonX is a lightweight, declarative C library designed to simplify JSON serialization and deserialization in embedded environments. Built as a specialized layer over the popular [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) library, JsonX introduces an embedded-first memory model and a structured mapping system. By using a declarative approach, developers can map C structures directly to JSON formats without the overhead of manual tree manipulation or complex dynamic memory management.

The library is designed with the constraints of microcontrollers like the STM32 and ARM Cortex-M series in mind. It follows the naming conventions and architectural style of Azure RTOS (formerly ThreadX), making it a natural fit for developers already familiar with `nx_`, `fx_`, or `tx_` style APIs.

## Key Features and RTOS Integration

One of the standout features of JsonX is its flexible memory management. It provides out-of-the-box compatibility with several common embedded execution environments:

- **ThreadX (Azure RTOS):** Native support for `TX_BYTE_POOL` memory allocation.
- **FreeRTOS:** Direct integration with `pvPortMalloc()` and `vPortFree()`.
- **Bare-metal:** Support for both standard `malloc` or a completely static buffer allocator for systems without a heap.
- **Custom Hooks:** Developers can define their own allocator hooks for platform-independent memory control.

## The JX_ELEMENT Mapping System

At the heart of JsonX is the `JX_ELEMENT` structure. Instead of writing imperative code to build or traverse a JSON tree, you define a flat array of elements that describe your data. This array acts as a blueprint for both parsing (JSON to C) and serialization (C to JSON).

Supported types include strings, numbers (mapped as doubles to maintain cJSON compatibility), booleans, nested objects, and arrays. This declarative style significantly reduces the boilerplate code required to handle complex, nested JSON structures.

### Example Mapping

Defining a mapping for a simple user structure is straightforward using the provided helper macros:

```c
struct {
    char name[32];
    double coords[2];
} test_struct;

// Define the JSON structure mapping
JX_ELEMENT user[] = {
    JX_PROPERTY_STRING("name", test_struct.name),
    JX_PROPERTY_ARRAY("position", (JX_ELEMENT[]) {
        JX_NUMBER_VAL(test_struct.coords[0]),
        JX_NUMBER_VAL(test_struct.coords[1])
    })
};
```

## Technical Implementation

JsonX is designed to be highly configurable via `jx_config.h`. Users can toggle features and adjust constants like `JX_PROPERTY_MAX_SIZE` to tune the library's RAM footprint. This is particularly useful for extremely resource-constrained targets where every byte of stack or heap counts.

The library also includes a robust logging abstraction. If `JX_DEBUG` is enabled, developers can use `jx_log()` to track operations and `jx_dump_structure()` to print a human-readable tree of the JSON mapping, which is invaluable during the debugging phase of firmware development.

## Getting Started

Initialization varies based on your target environment. For a ThreadX-based system, you would pass a byte pool to the library:

```c
TX_BYTE_POOL byte_pool;
// ... pool creation ...
jx_init(&byte_pool);
```

Once initialized, converting a C structure to a JSON string is a single function call:

```c
char json_buf[256];
jx_struct_to_json(user, 2, json_buf, sizeof(json_buf), JX_FORMATTED);
```

Parsing is equally simple, supporting both strict and non-strict modes to handle varying levels of data validation requirements. By abstracting the underlying cJSON logic, JsonX allows embedded developers to focus on their data structures rather than the intricacies of JSON syntax parsing.
