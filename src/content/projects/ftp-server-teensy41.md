## Overview

The FTP_Server_Teensy41 library provides a robust FTP server implementation specifically optimized for the Teensy 4.x platform. Modified from the original Arduino-Ftp-Server library, this version is tailored to leverage the advanced networking capabilities of the Teensy 4.1 and 4.0 microcontrollers. It allows developers to turn their embedded devices into accessible file servers, facilitating remote data logging, configuration updates, and file management over Ethernet or WiFi.

## Extensive Hardware and Network Support

A key strength of this library is its versatility regarding network hardware. It is designed to work with a variety of stacks and controllers, ensuring compatibility with different hardware configurations:

- **Teensy 4.1 Built-in Ethernet**: Supports both `QNEthernet` (based on lwIP) and `NativeEthernet` libraries.
- **External Ethernet**: Compatible with W5x00 series controllers (W5100, W5500) via the `Ethernet_Generic` library.
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Supports the Adafruit Airlift Featherwing using the `WiFiNINA_Generic` library.

This broad support makes it an ideal choice for industrial IoT gateways, remote monitoring stations, or any Teensy-based project requiring network-based file access.

## Storage and Filesystem Integration

Currently, the library provides full support for SD cards using the `SDFat2` library, which is the standard for high-speed storage on Teensy devices. The implementation handles standard FTP operations including file uploads (STOR), downloads (RETR), directory listing (LIST), and file deletion (DELE). 

Future updates are planned to extend support to other storage mediums and filesystems, including LittleFS, PSRAM, and (Q)SPI Flash. This will allow the library to be used in compact designs that rely on internal flash memory rather than external SD cards.

## Technical Features and Debugging

The library is built with developer experience in mind. It includes a comprehensive debugging system that can be output to the Serial port, with adjustable log levels from 0 to 4. This allows for real-time monitoring of client connections, authentication processes, and data transfer speeds. 

Recent enhancements have introduced configurable credential lengths, supporting usernames up to 63 characters and passwords up to 127 characters. It also addresses critical performance issues, such as fixing bugs related to incomplete file downloads, ensuring reliable data integrity during transfers.

## Getting Started

Integrating the FTP server into a project is straightforward. After configuring the network interface (Ethernet or WiFi) and initializing the SD card, the FTP server is started with a simple call to `begin()` with the desired credentials. The `handleFTP()` method must be called within the main loop to process incoming requests.

```cpp
#include <FTP_Server_Teensy41.h>

FtpServer ftpServer;

void setup() {
  // Initialize Serial, SD card, and Ethernet/WiFi here
  // ...

  // Start the FTP server with account and password
  ftpServer.begin("teensy4x", "ftp_test");
}

void loop() {
  // Handle FTP client requests
  ftpServer.handleFTP();
}
```

## Community and Contributions

The project is maintained by Khoi Hoang and benefits from the contributions of the embedded community. It is licensed under the GPLv3, encouraging open-source collaboration and enhancement. Users are encouraged to report issues or suggest features via the project's GitHub repository to help evolve the library's capabilities.
