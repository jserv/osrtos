## Overview

The FatFs Tiva-cm4f port is a specialized implementation of the popular FatFs generic file system module, specifically optimized for the Texas Instruments Tiva C Series TM4C123 Launchpad. This library modifies the standard drivers provided by TI to introduce Direct Memory Access (DMA) functionality for sector transmissions. By offloading data movement to the uDMA controller, the port significantly reduces CPU overhead and increases data throughput during MMC/SD card operations on ARM Cortex-M4F hardware.

## Performance and DMA Capabilities

The core value of this port lies in its performance optimizations. By utilizing the uDMA controller on the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller, the driver can handle large data blocks without constant CPU intervention. The project includes several preprocessor switches that allow developers to fine-tune the driver's behavior:

- `USE_DMA_TX` and `USE_DMA_RX`: Enable DMA-based write and read functions.
- `USE_SCATTERGATHER`: Enables scatter-gather DMA functionality for more complex memory operations.

Benchmarks provided in the project documentation demonstrate the impact of these optimizations. In tests using an 8 MHz SPI clock and 8192-byte transfers, switching from standard I/O to DMA-based I/O improved write speeds by approximately 3.47x and read speeds by over 4.2x. These gains make the library particularly suitable for data-logging applications or systems requiring high-speed access to external storage.

## RTOS and Bare-Metal Support

While the library can be used in bare-metal environments, it features built-in support for FreeRTOS. By enabling the `USE_FREERTOS` preprocessor switch, the driver implements semaphore-based blocking for read and write operations. This ensures that the calling task yields during I/O wait states, allowing the FreeRTOS scheduler to run other tasks and improving overall system efficiency.

## Technical Implementation

The driver is designed for use with the Code Composer Studio (CCS) compiler and integrates with TI's TivaWare peripheral driver library. It includes a dedicated interrupt handler, `SDCSSIIntHandler`, which is assigned to the `SSI0` peripheral and must be included in the application's interrupt vector table.

For ease of use, the driver can automatically initialize the `uDMAControlTable`. However, it is flexible enough to accommodate applications that already manage the DMA control table elsewhere; in such cases, the internal initialization lines can be easily commented out to prevent memory conflicts.

## Hardware Compatibility

The project targets the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture, specifically the TI TM4C123 Launchpad (EK-TM4C123GXL). It leverages the hardware's Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) and uDMA peripherals to communicate with SD cards in SPI mode. The repository includes sample code for both simple bare-metal implementations (`main_simple.c`) and RTOS-integrated applications (`main_rtos.c`), providing a clear path for developers to integrate high-speed file system support into their Tiva-based projects.
