## Overview

The LPIoT project is a specialized implementation of low-power wireless networking designed for the Internet of Things. Built on top of the Contiki OS, it focuses on creating an efficient communication infrastructure for resource-constrained devices. The project is structured to support various node roles, including sensors that collect data, forwarders that handle routing, and controllers that manage the network logic.

## Technical Architecture

The system is built using the Contiki OS and leverages the Rime communication stack, a lightweight networking protocol suite designed specifically for low-power wireless sensors. The project architecture is modular, with source code organized into several key components:

- **Node Logic**: Specialized implementations for different device roles (Controller, Forwarder, and Sensor).
- **Connection Management**: Handles beaconing, data forwarding, and unicast buffering to ensure reliable communication.
- **Logger & Tools**: Integrated logging and utility functions for system monitoring.
- **Energy Statistics**: Uses the `simple_energest` module to track power consumption, which is critical for evaluating the longevity of battery-powered IoT devices.

## Hardware and Simulation Support

The project provides native support for two primary environments:

- **Zolertia Firefly (Zoul)**: A popular hardware platform for IoT research and development. The build system includes specific configurations for the Zoul target, including linker flags for the ARM Cortex-M3 based hardware.
- **TMote Sky / Cooja**: For simulation and rapid prototyping, the project supports the TMote Sky target, which is the standard platform for the Cooja simulator. This allows developers to test network scenarios and analyze performance before deploying to physical hardware.

## Performance Analysis and Statistics

A significant feature of this project is its focus on data-driven analysis. By enabling the `STATS` flag during compilation, the system generates detailed logs regarding energy consumption and network behavior. These logs can be processed using provided Python scripts to parse statistics from either the Cooja simulator or physical testbeds. This enables a deep understanding of the network's efficiency and helps in optimizing the low-power characteristics of the implementation.

## Getting Started

The project uses a standard Makefile-based build system. Compiling for the default target (TMote Sky) is as simple as running `make`. For hardware deployment on the Zolertia Firefly, the `TARGET=zoul` flag is used. The repository also includes recipes for cleaning the environment and managing testbed logs, ensuring a streamlined development workflow for IoT researchers and developers.
