The `mbed-libs` repository serves as a centralized collection of libraries specifically tailored for ARM Mbed OS. Targeting version 5 of the Mbed OS platform, these libraries are designed to extend the capabilities of the RTOS, providing developers with reusable components for their embedded projects.

Mbed OS is a widely used open-source operating system for the Internet of Things, specifically designed for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. By providing a set of libraries compatible with this ecosystem, `mbed-libs` helps streamline the development process for engineers working on Mbed-enabled hardware. The project focuses on providing modular code that can be easily integrated into existing Mbed projects.

While the repository is focused on Mbed OS 5, it represents the modular nature of the Mbed ecosystem, where drivers, protocol stacks, and utility libraries can be easily integrated into a project. Developers using Mbed OS often rely on such community-contributed or organized library sets to handle specific hardware peripherals or software protocols without reinventing the wheel.

### Key Aspects

- **Compatibility**: Specifically designed for ARM Mbed OS 5.
- **Hardware Focus**: Targets ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers and Mbed-enabled development boards.
- **Modular Design**: Provides a structure for reusable software components in embedded development.

For developers working within the Mbed environment, these libraries offer a way to leverage existing codebases to speed up prototyping and production development. By utilizing these pre-built components, developers can focus on their application logic rather than low-level driver implementation.
