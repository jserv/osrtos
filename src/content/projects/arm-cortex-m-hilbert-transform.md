## Bringing the Hilbert Transform to ARM Cortex-M

In the world of digital signal processing (DSP), the Hilbert Transform is a fundamental tool. It allows engineers to create an analytic representation of a real-valued signal, which is essential for tasks like envelope detection, instantaneous frequency estimation, and single-sideband modulation. The **ARM-Cortex-M-Hilbert-Transform** repository provides a lightweight, efficient implementation of this transform specifically tailored for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

### Why Use This Library?

While the standard CMSIS-DSP library provided by ARM is incredibly comprehensive, it doesn't always include every specific transform out of the box. This project fills that gap by providing functions that follow the naming conventions and architectural patterns of CMSIS-DSP, making it a natural fit for developers already working within the ARM ecosystem. It is particularly useful for applications requiring complex signal analysis on edge devices where computational efficiency is paramount.

### The Algorithm Under the Hood

The implementation follows a classic frequency-domain approach, similar to the `hilbert()` function found in MATLAB. The process involves three main steps:

1.  **FFT Computation**: The input vector is transformed into the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform.
2.  **Spectral Manipulation**: The frequency components are modified to zero out negative frequencies and double the positive ones. Specifically:
    *   The DC component (index 0) and the Nyquist component (index N/2) are multiplied by 1.
    *   Positive frequencies (indices 1 to N/2 - 1) are multiplied by 2.
    *   Negative frequencies (indices N/2 + 1 to N-1) are multiplied by 0.
3.  **IFFT Computation**: An Inverse Fast Fourier Transform is performed on the modified vector to return to the time domain, resulting in the complex analytic signal.

### Integration and Usage

Integrating the library into an existing CMSIS-based project is straightforward. You only need to include two files in your source group: `arm_chilbert_f32.c` and `arm_hilbert.h`. 

The library supports power-of-two signal lengths ranging from 16 to 4096 samples. Because it relies on CMSIS-DSP, it is designed to benefit from the hardware acceleration features (such as SIMD instructions) available on various Cortex-M cores.

### Example Implementation

To get started, you can refer to the logic provided in the `test.c` example. The usage pattern typically involves initializing your data buffers and calling the Hilbert function as follows:

```c
#include "arm_hilbert.h"

// Define your buffer size (must be a power of 2 between 16 and 4096)
#define TEST_LENGTH_SAMPLES 128

float32_t testInput[TEST_LENGTH_SAMPLES];
// Output is complex, so it requires 2x the space (Real/Imaginary pairs)
float32_t testOutput[TEST_LENGTH_SAMPLES * 2]; 

// ... Initialize testInput with your signal data ...

// Compute the Hilbert Transform
// Ensure your project is linked against CMSIS-DSP
arm_chilbert_f32(testInput, testOutput, TEST_LENGTH_SAMPLES);
```

### Conclusion

For developers working on advanced signal analysis on the edge, having a reliable Hilbert Transform implementation is invaluable. By building upon the robust CMSIS-DSP foundation, this project provides a high-performance solution for generating analytic signals on ARM hardware with minimal integration overhead.
