## Overview

The Conveyor Belt Fault Detection System is a multi-modal industrial IoT solution designed to automate the inspection of conveyor belts. In industrial environments, conveyor belts are critical components prone to tears, cracks, and gradual thinning. If left unmonitored, these issues can lead to catastrophic failures and significant production losses. This project addresses these challenges by combining computer vision and ultrasonic distance sensing to provide a comprehensive health monitoring system.

The system architecture is split between edge data collection and centralized processing. An ESP32-CAM module is positioned above the belt to capture real-time imagery, while an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, managed by an Arduino Uno, measures the belt's thickness to detect wear that might not be visible to the naked eye.

## Technical Implementation

### Vision-Based Fault Detection
The core of the visual inspection system is the InceptionV3 deep learning model. The project includes a training pipeline using TensorFlow and Keras, where images of conveyor belts are classified into categories such as normal, slightly damaged, moderately damaged, and severely damaged. 

The ESP32-CAM acts as a wireless node, streaming video to a local Flask-based web server. This server performs the heavy lifting of image classification, allowing the system to maintain high accuracy (>95%) without requiring high-performance computing at the edge.

### Thickness Measurement
While the camera detects surface anomalies, the ultrasonic sensor focuses on structural integrity. The Arduino Uno calculates the distance to the belt surface and compares it against a reference value to determine wear. The logic is implemented in a straightforward C++ sketch:

```cpp
// Calculate the distance in millimeters
float distance = (duration / 2.0) * SOUND_SPEED;
float dis = ref - distance;

Serial.print("Thickness of the belt: ");
Serial.print(dis);
Serial.println(" mm");

// Check if replacement is needed
float thickness_threshold = 2.00; 
if (thickness_threshold <= dis) {
  Serial.println("No replacement is required.");
} else {
  Serial.println("Replacement required.");
}
```

## Key Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous detection of conveyor belt damage using a camera module and ultrasonic sensor.
- **Damage Classification**: Automated severity assessment (Normal to Severely Damaged) using the InceptionV3 AI model.
- **Precision Sensing**: Thickness measurement with a precision of ±0.1mm to track belt wear over time.
- **Automated Safety**: The system can trigger automated alerts and emergency shutdowns for severe faults to prevent hardware damage.
- **IoT Integration**: Data is visualized via a local webpage dashboard, allowing operators to monitor the system remotely.

## Getting Started

To deploy the system, the hardware must be configured with the ESP32-CAM mounted above the belt and the ultrasonic sensor positioned near the rollers. The repository provides the necessary firmware for both the ESP32 and the Arduino Uno. 

Users must train the AI model using the provided Jupyter notebook (`DeepLearning.ipynb`) with a dataset specific to their conveyor environment. Once the model is trained and the Flask server is running, the system begins real-time inference on the incoming video stream while simultaneously logging thickness data from the Arduino controller.
