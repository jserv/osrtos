## Overview

100ASK Linux LVGL Desktop is an MIT-licensed open-source project developed by the 100ASK Team. It serves as a comprehensive reference solution for creating graphical user interfaces on embedded Linux systems. The project is designed with three core principles in mind: low memory consumption, a clean and modern visual aesthetic, and a stable, highly extensible architecture.

While primarily targeting the 100ASK_IMX6ULL and 100ASK_STM32MP157 development boards, the project is highly portable. Because it uses a standard Makefile structure and GCC-based compilation, it can be adapted to almost any Linux-based development board with minimal configuration changes.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The desktop environment provides a full-featured GUI experience tailored for resource-constrained embedded hardware. Key highlights include:

- **Modular Architecture**: The project is split into several sub-repositories, including `lv_100ask_modules` for common UI components and `lv_100ask_app` for specific applications.
- **D-Bus Integration**: It utilizes D-Bus for inter-process communication (IPC), allowing the main desktop process to manage and launch independent application processes seamlessly.
- **Hardware Optimization**: Includes specific support for hardware-related tasks such as LCD brightness control, WLAN/LAN configuration, and system time settings for the i.MX6ULL platform.
- **Rich Application Suite**: Comes with built-in general-purpose applications including a file manager, music player, calculator, and various games (2048, Snake, Memory).
- **Visual Polish**: Includes a boot animation module and a custom desktop icon initialization system to provide a professional "out-of-the-box" user experience.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built on top of the LVGL (Lightweight and Versatile Graphics Library) version 8.x. It leverages the standard Linux framebuffer (`/dev/fb0`) for display output and the `evdev` interface for input handling (touchscreens and mice). 

The build system is managed via a central Makefile that handles cross-compilation for ARM-based targets. A significant technical detail is the project's reliance on the D-Bus library for its service-based application model. Each application is defined by a `.service` file, allowing the main desktop to trigger executables via the D-Bus message bus.

### Directory Structure

- `assets/`: Contains icons, background images, and D-Bus service definitions.
- `lv_100ask_app/`: The primary location for developing new applications.
- `lv_100ask_modules/`: Contains reusable modules like the assistive touch ball, boot animations, and D-Bus handlers.
- `lv_drivers/`: Standard LVGL drivers for Linux framebuffers and input devices.
- `lvgl/`: The core LVGL graphics library submodule.

## Getting Started

To build the project, users typically need a cross-compilation environment (such as VMware with Ubuntu). The process involves cloning the repository and its submodules:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/100askTeam/lv_100ask_linux_desktop
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Compilation is handled via `make`. For those using the 100ASK IMX6ULL SDK, the Makefile is pre-configured to point to the appropriate toolchain paths. Once compiled, the resulting binaries in the `bin/` directory are transferred to the target board along with the `assets/` folder. 

Before running the main desktop program (`100ask_lvgl_Main`), users must initialize the D-Bus environment on the target board using `export $(dbus-launch)` and ensure that the `.service` files are correctly placed in the system's D-Bus services directory (usually `/usr/share/dbus-1/services/`).

## Community and Support

The 100ASK team provides extensive documentation and video tutorials for LVGL and embedded Linux development. Users can find technical support and community discussions on the official 100ASK forums and wiki.
