## Overview

The ESP32 64-Band Audio Spectrum Analyser is a high-performance audio visualization project designed for the ESP32 microcontroller. By leveraging the dual-core processing power of the ESP32, the system performs real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis on incoming audio signals, translating sound into a dynamic visual representation across 64 distinct frequency bands. 

This project is particularly well-suited for audio enthusiasts looking to add a professional-grade visual element to their desk setup or home audio system. It supports multiple visualization modes and hardware configurations, making it a versatile tool for real-time signal analysis.

## Technical Implementation

The core of the project relies on the **Kiss FFT** library to handle the computationally intensive task of frequency analysis. Audio data is captured via the ESP32's internal Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) for line-in signals or through I2S for digital audio input. The software then processes these samples to calculate the magnitude of various frequency components.

The project is built using the **PlatformIO IDE** and the **Arduino framework**, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. It utilizes the Adafruit GFX and SSD1306/SSD1322 library stacks to drive high-resolution OLED displays, providing smooth animations and low-latency visual feedback.

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Visualization**: Supports 32, 42, or 64 band column modes to suit different display preferences.
- **Dynamic Peak Handling**: Includes two modes of peak holders with adjustable peak delay times, allowing for a more aesthetic and readable frequency response.
- **Hardware Flexibility**: Designed around the ESP32 Wemos Mini form factor, featuring an onboard audio gain adjuster for fine-tuning line-in signal levels.
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Capable of processing standard analog line-in signals or integrating with Bluetooth audio via the ESP32-A2DP library.

## Hardware and Design

The repository includes comprehensive resources for building the physical device, including:
- **Schematics**: Detailed wiring diagrams for connecting the ESP32 to the OLED display and audio input circuitry.
- **PCB Gerber Files**: Production-ready files for creating a custom printed circuit board to house the components.
- **OLED Support**: While configured for SSD1322 256x64 screens for a wide-aspect visual, the code is adaptable to other common display controllers.

## Software Configuration

The project's environment is managed via `platformio.ini`, which defines dependencies such as the `arduino-audio-tools` and `ESP32-A2DP` libraries. This setup allows the device to function not just as a wired analyzer, but potentially as a wireless Bluetooth audio sink that visualizes the stream as it plays. The use of the `esp32_exception_decoder` filter in the build configuration ensures that developers can easily debug the firmware during customization.
