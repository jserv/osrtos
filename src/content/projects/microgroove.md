Microgroove is an open-source hardware MIDI sequence generator designed to bring generative sequencing techniques—often found in modular synthesis and software environments—to a standalone desktop MIDI setup. Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico, it provides an 8-track environment where users can generate and manipulate sequences in real-time using a variety of algorithmic "Machines."

## Generative Sequencing Philosophy

The project is inspired by modular tools like the Turing Machine and Mutable Instruments Grids, as well as the workflow of Elektron hardware. Microgroove uses a "Machine" concept where different algorithms generate rhythm and melody independently. 

Users can explore several generation methods:
- **Random Melodies**: Generates unpredictable note patterns.
- **Euclidean Rhythms**: Creates mathematically distributed trigger patterns.
- **Grids Rhythms**: Implements rhythms based on the popular Mutable Instruments Grids module.
- **Quantization**: Melodies can be constrained to specific scales and keys.
- **Groove & Swing**: Includes MPC-style swing and the ability to create call-and-response structures between tracks.

## Technical Architecture

The firmware is written in Rust and utilizes the **RTIC (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency)** framework. This choice allows for highly accurate timing (down to a few microseconds), which is critical for musical applications where jitter can be audible. 

The software follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, split into two distinct crates:
1. **microgroove_sequencer**: A platform-independent library implementing the data model (Sequencer, Track, Step, Note) and the generation logic. This separation allows the core logic to be unit-tested on a standard PC.
2. **microgroove_app**: The hardware-specific binary crate that handles the OLED display (View) and user input/MIDI processing (Controller).

## Hardware Design

Microgroove is designed to be DIY-friendly, utilizing standard components that can be assembled on a breadboard or protoboard. The core components include:
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: The primary microcontroller.
- **128x64 Monochrome OLED**: For visual feedback and parameter editing.
- **Rotary Encoders & Mechanical Keys**: Six encoders and four Cherry MX-compatible keys provide a tactile interface similar to professional grooveboxes.
- **MIDI I/O**: Simple optoisolated MIDI input and buffered MIDI output circuits, compatible with both TRS minijacks and classic DIN jacks.

The project also includes a laser-cut case design, which can be customized via Tinkercad, making it a complete hardware project from electronics to enclosure.

## Development and Extensibility

Because the project is open-source and written in Rust, it serves as a platform for experimentation. Developers can easily create new "Machines" by implementing the `Machine` trait and adding them to the generation pipeline. The build system uses `cargo-embed` for flashing and supports serial debugging, providing a modern development experience for embedded audio projects.
