The MicroPython Examples repository by 01Studio serves as a central resource for developers using 01Studio's ecosystem of development boards. MicroPython has become a premier choice for rapid prototyping in the embedded world, and this collection provides the necessary building blocks to interface with various hardware peripherals across multiple silicon architectures.

## Hardware Platform Support

The repository is organized by hardware platform, reflecting the broad support 01Studio provides for different microcontrollers. This structure allows developers to find code specific to their board's pinout and hardware capabilities. Key platforms supported include:

*   **ESP32 Series**: Extensive examples for the ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-C3, focusing on WiFi connectivity, web servers, and general I/O.
*   **AI & Machine Vision**: Support for the K210 (pyAI-K210) and OpenMV4, which are geared towards edge AI applications, image processing, and neural network inference.
*   **STM32 Ecosystem**: Examples for classic STM32F405 and STM32F407 (Columbus) boards, as well as specialized chips like the TKM32F499 (DaVinci).
*   **Wireless & Low Power**: Dedicated resources for the nRF52840 (pyBLE) focusing on Bluetooth Low Energy and the Raspberry Pi Pico (pyPico) for RP2040-based development.

## Technical Scope

Each directory typically contains scripts for common embedded tasks, abstracting the complexity of the underlying hardware through MicroPython's high-level syntax. The examples cover a wide range of functionality:

*   **Basic Peripherals**: GPIO control, PWM for LEDs and motors, and ADC for analog sensors.
*   **Communication Protocols**: Implementation of I2C, SPI, and UART for interfacing with external sensors, displays, and modules.
*   **Advanced Networking**: WiFi and BLE stack usage for IoT applications, including MQTT and socket programming.
*   **Specialized Hardware**: Drivers for LCDs, touchscreens, and camera modules specific to 01Studio's development kits.

## Practical Application

This repository is particularly valuable for users of 01Studio hardware who need verified code snippets to get their projects running quickly. By providing a consistent set of examples across different architectures, it demonstrates the portability of MicroPython code while highlighting the specific strengths of each hardware platform—from the low-power Bluetooth capabilities of the nRF52840 to the high-performance AI acceleration of the K210. Whether you are building a simple IoT sensor node or a complex machine vision system, these examples provide a solid foundation for embedded Python development.
