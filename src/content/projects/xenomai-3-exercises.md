## Overview

Xenomai 3 Exercises is a repository dedicated to learning and implementing real-time programming concepts using the Xenomai 3 framework. Xenomai is a real-time development framework cooperating with the Linux kernel to provide pervasive, interface-agnostic, hard real-time support to user-space applications. This project serves as a practical guide for developers looking to understand how to bridge the gap between standard Linux environments and strict real-time requirements.

The repository contains a series of completed exercises originally based on the curriculum from Radboud University. These exercises are designed to take a developer from the basics of setting up a Xenomai environment to managing complex task interactions and scheduling behaviors.

## Key Learning Modules

The project is organized into several distinct directories, each focusing on a core pillar of Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) programming:

### Getting Started
This module covers the initial setup and the basic structure of a Xenomai application. It introduces the Alchemy API, which is the primary interface for Xenomai 3 applications, replacing the older native skins found in Xenomai 2.

### Multi-Tasking and Task Management
Real-time systems rely on the ability to manage multiple concurrent tasks with deterministic behavior. These exercises demonstrate how to create, start, and manage tasks within the Xenomai environment, ensuring that high-priority tasks meet their deadlines without being blocked by lower-priority processes.

### Synchronization with Semaphores
Inter-task communication and synchronization are critical in embedded systems. The repository includes practical implementations of semaphores to manage shared resources and synchronize task execution, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity.

### Advanced Scheduling Algorithms
One of the most important aspects of an RTOS is how it handles CPU allocation. The exercises explore two primary scheduling methods:
- **Preemptive Priority-Based Scheduling**: Understanding how the scheduler interrupts lower-priority tasks to serve higher-priority ones immediately.
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: Implementing time-slicing among tasks of the same priority level to ensure fair CPU distribution.

## Technical Context

Xenomai 3 represents a significant evolution from its predecessor. While Xenomai 2 solutions are common, this repository specifically targets the Xenomai 3 architecture. It utilizes the Cobalt core, which is a small real-time kernel that runs side-by-side with the Linux kernel using the I-pipe (Interrupt Pipeline) or Dovetail mechanism. This allows the system to handle time-critical interrupts with minimal latency while still providing access to standard Linux services for non-critical tasks.

## Getting Started with the Exercises

To use these exercises, developers typically need a Linux system with the Xenomai 3 libraries and headers installed. The code examples demonstrate the use of the Alchemy API, which provides a familiar environment for those coming from traditional RTOS backgrounds like VxWorks or pSOS. Each directory contains source code and write-ups that explain the logic behind the solutions, making it an excellent resource for self-paced learning in the field of real-time embedded systems.
