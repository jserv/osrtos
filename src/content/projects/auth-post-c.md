In the world of IoT and embedded systems, securing web interfaces is a critical requirement. The **auth-post-c** project provides a clean, C-based implementation of a Mongoose OS application that focuses specifically on securing HTTP endpoints using Digest Access Authentication.

### Overview of auth-post-c

This project serves as a reference implementation for developers looking to build secure web services on microcontrollers. By leveraging Mongoose OS, the project simplifies the complexities of networking and authentication, allowing developers to focus on application logic. The core functionality revolves around three distinct HTTP endpoints, each protected to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the device.

### Secure Authentication with Digest Access

Unlike Basic Authentication, which sends credentials in a format that is easily reversible, Digest Access Authentication applies a hash function to the password before sending it over the network. This project demonstrates how to integrate this security layer within an embedded environment. 

The repository includes a standard `htpasswd` file within the `fs` (filesystem) directory, which is used to store the credentials required for access. This approach mirrors traditional web server configurations, making it familiar to developers with a background in web technologies.

### Technical Structure and Configuration

The project is structured to work seamlessly with the Mongoose OS build tool (`mos`). The key components include:

- **src/main.c**: The entry point of the application where the HTTP handlers and authentication logic are defined.
- **mos.yml**: The configuration manifest that defines the app's dependencies, hardware configuration, and build settings.
- **fs/**: This directory represents the device's local filesystem. It contains:
  - `index.html`: The web interface served by the device.
  - `conf1.json`: A configuration file used by the application.
  - `htpasswd`: The security file containing user credentials.

### Getting Started

To use this project, you typically need the Mongoose OS toolchain installed. Because it is a standard Mongoose OS app, the workflow involves flashing the firmware to a supported microcontroller (such as an ESP32 or ESP8266) and then uploading the files in the `fs` directory. 

Once deployed, the device will host a web server. When a user attempts to access the protected endpoints or the `index.html` page, the browser will prompt for the credentials defined in the `htpasswd` file. This setup is particularly useful for administrative panels or data-entry forms where security is paramount.

### Why This Project Matters

For many embedded developers, implementing robust security from scratch is a daunting task. **auth-post-c** provides a "batteries-included" example of how to handle POST requests securely. By studying the interaction between the C code in `main.c` and the configuration files in the filesystem, developers can learn how to protect their IoT devices from unauthorized access while maintaining a lightweight footprint suitable for resource-constrained hardware.
