Cloudhome is an emerging home automation system designed to provide a robust firmware foundation for smart devices. While currently a work-in-progress, the project leverages the Mongoose OS framework to handle the complexities of IoT development, such as networking, security, and over-the-air updates.

## Technical Foundation

The project is built on **Mongoose OS**, a popular choice for connected products due to its focus on low-resource microcontrollers like the ESP32 and ESP8266. The presence of the `mos.yml` configuration file indicates that the project utilizes the Mongoose OS build system, which manages dependencies, hardware configuration, and filesystem assets.

The repository structure follows the standard Mongoose OS layout:
- **src/**: Contains the core application logic written in C (`main.c`).
- **fs/**: Holds files that are flashed onto the device's internal filesystem, including a web-based dashboard (`index.html`).
- **cert.pem**: Suggests that the firmware is designed with security in mind, likely using this certificate for encrypted communication with a cloud backend or local server.

## Key Features and Capabilities

One of the standout aspects of Cloudhome is its integrated web interface. By including an `index.html` file in the `fs/` directory, the firmware can serve a local configuration or control page directly from the device. This allows users to interact with their home automation hardware through a browser without needing a dedicated mobile app for basic setup.

Security is also a visible priority. The inclusion of a PEM certificate indicates that the system is prepared for TLS/SSL communication, which is critical for protecting home automation data as it travels across a network.

## Getting Started with the Firmware

Because this project uses Mongoose OS, developers typically interact with it using the `mos` tool. The `mos.yml` file defines the app's identity and the libraries it pulls in. To build and flash this firmware, a developer would generally use commands such as:

```bash
mos build --platform esp32
mos flash
```

The logic within `src/main.c` serves as the entry point, where the Mongoose OS event loop is initialized and hardware peripherals (like GPIOs for lights or sensors) are configured. As a work-in-progress, Cloudhome represents a clean starting point for anyone looking to build a custom, secure home automation node with a built-in web UI.
