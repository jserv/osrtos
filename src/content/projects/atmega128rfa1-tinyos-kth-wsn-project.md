The **atmega128rfa1-tinyos-kth-wsn** repository is a specialized collection of software components and applications built for the ATmega128RFA1, a popular microcontroller that integrates an AVR core with a 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 radio. Developed within the context of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) research at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, this project provides a robust foundation for building low-power wireless applications using the TinyOS operating system.

## Project Overview and Architecture

This project is structured around the TinyOS component model, utilizing the nesC programming language. It serves as both a development playground and a production-ready codebase for WSN deployments. The repository includes several sub-projects ranging from low-level hardware tests to complex application-level logic. 

One of the most significant parts of the repository is the `modified-tinyos-main` directory. This contains specific modifications to the core TinyOS library required to support the ATmega128RFA1 platform effectively. These modifications cover chip-specific drivers and platform configurations that may not be present in the standard TinyOS distribution.

## Key Applications and Components

### SensorAppC: The Core Application
The flagship application in this repository is `SensorAppC`. This is the primary software intended for deployment on ATmega128RFA1 nodes. It follows the standard nesC pattern of separating configuration (`C` files) from implementation (`P` files). 

Key files within this application include:
- **bb.nc**: The top-level component that wires the system together.
- **ControllerP.nc**: Manages the high-level logic and state transitions.
- **SensorSubsystemP.nc**: Handles data acquisition from the hardware sensors.
- **RadioSubsystemP.nc**: Manages wireless communication and packet handling.

### Communication and Serial Forwarding
To bridge the gap between the wireless sensor network and a host computer (such as an Alix board), the project includes the `SerialPacketForwarder`. This component is designed to reliably move data between the radio interface and the serial port, allowing for real-time monitoring and command injection from a PC or gateway.

### Hardware Testing and Validation
Before deploying complex logic, the project provides several utility applications to validate hardware functionality:
- **AdcTest**: A modified version of the classic TinyOS 'Blink' application that adds ADC driver testing via `PlatformSensorC` and outputs data over `PlatformSerialC`.
- **RadioCountToLedsAM**: A test project for radio connectivity, based on standard TinyOS dissemination and collection templates.
- **SerialPortNoTiny**: For developers needing to debug hardware without the abstraction of an OS, this directory contains a pure C project for testing the ATmega128RFA1 serial port.

## Technical Details and Packet Handling

The project uses a unified header file, `packet_types.h`, which defines the communication protocol used across the entire system. This file is shared between the TinyOS code running on the nodes and the C/Python programs running on the gateway (Alix) side. It defines structures for commands, status updates, and data packets, ensuring consistency across the network.

### Example Makefile Integration

The project integrates with the TinyOS-Plugin for Eclipse, but also maintains standard Makefiles for command-line builds. A typical `Makefile` in the project looks like this:

```makefile
COMPONENT=RadioCountToLedsAppC
BUILD_EXTRA_DEPS = RadioCountMsg.py RadioCountMsg.class
CLEAN_EXTRA = RadioCountMsg.py RadioCountMsg.class RadioCountMsg.java

RadioCountMsg.py: RadioCountToLeds.h
	mig python -target=$(PLATFORM) $(CFLAGS) -python-classname=RadioCountMsg RadioCountToLeds.h radio_count_msg -o $@

include $(MAKERULES)
```

This snippet demonstrates the use of `mig` (Message Interface Generator) to automatically create Python and Java bindings for the network packets defined in C headers, facilitating easy integration with high-level monitoring tools.

## Getting Started

To use this project, developers typically need to:
1. Set up a TinyOS development environment.
2. Apply the modifications found in `modified-tinyos-main` to their local TinyOS installation using the provided scripts.
3. Navigate to a specific application directory (like `SensorAppC/src`) and run `make <platform>` to compile the hex file for the ATmega128RFA1 target.
