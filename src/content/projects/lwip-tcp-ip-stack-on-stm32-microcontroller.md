## Overview

The `stm32_lwip` repository provides a practical implementation of the lwIP (lightweight IP) TCP/IP stack on STM32 microcontrollers. Specifically targeting the STM32F767 on a Nucleo-144 development board, this project serves as a reference for developers looking to integrate networking capabilities into their embedded systems using FreeRTOS.

The repository is organized into two distinct project versions: `lwip_203` and `lwip_212`. The first was generated using the STM32CubeIDE configurator (CubeMX) and utilizes lwIP version 2.0.3. The second version, `lwip_212`, updates the stack to version 2.1.2 while maintaining the same core functionality. Both projects are built upon the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, ensuring that network processing can occur concurrently with other system tasks.

## Core Functionality

When the firmware starts, the system initializes the hardware and the FreeRTOS scheduler. A status indicator (LD3 RED LED) begins blinking to signal that the application is running. The primary network feature demonstrated is the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) client. Upon connection to a network, the board sends out DHCP Discovery packets to request an IP address from a local server.

Once a DHCP server assigns an IP address to the board, the system becomes reachable over the network. Users can verify connectivity using standard tools like `ping` (ICMP). This setup demonstrates the full path from physical Ethernet connection to high-level protocol handling.

## Technical Implementation

The project is designed to be used with STM32CubeIDE. Developers can build the project using the standard IDE workflow and flash the resulting firmware via ST-LINK or J-Link. The use of FreeRTOS allows the lwIP stack to run in its own thread, which is the standard approach for handling complex networking tasks in embedded environments.

### Key Components
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F767 (ARM Cortex-M7)
- **Development Board**: Nucleo-144
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS
- **Network Stack**: lwIP (v2.0.3 and v2.1.2)
- **Development Environment**: STM32CubeIDE

## Testing and Debugging

For network debugging, the project suggests using `tcpdump` to capture and analyze traffic. By monitoring the network interface with specific flags (such as `-vv`), developers can observe the DHCP handshake in real-time and verify that the STM32 is communicating correctly with the network infrastructure. This visibility is crucial for troubleshooting timing issues or configuration mismatches in the TCP/IP stack.

This repository is an excellent starting point for embedded developers who need to understand how to bridge the gap between low-level Ethernet drivers and high-level TCP/IP protocols within a multi-threaded RTOS environment.
