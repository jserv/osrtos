The DIY Portrait-Mode Gamepad is a specialized hardware project designed to enhance the mobile gaming experience, particularly for titles and emulators that favor a vertical orientation. Built around the versatile Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller, this gamepad provides a physical interface for smartphones, connecting directly via a USB-C port to eliminate the latency and battery concerns associated with traditional Bluetooth controllers.

## Hardware and Design

The project is centered on a custom PCB and a fully 3D-printable enclosure. By leveraging the RP2040, the gamepad benefits from a powerful yet affordable dual-core processor capable of handling high-speed input tasks. The physical layout is specifically tailored for portrait-mode gaming, which is often neglected by mainstream controller manufacturers. However, the inclusion of side buttons ensures that the device remains functional for traditional landscape-mode gaming as well.

**Key hardware features include:**
- **RP2040 Microcontroller**: Provides the core processing power and native USB capabilities.
- **USB-C Connectivity**: Plugs directly into the phone, drawing power from the mobile device and acting as a standard HID controller.
- **3D-Printable Components**: All parts of the case and buttons are designed to be manufactured at home using standard 3D printing equipment.
- **Custom PCB**: A dedicated circuit board design ensures a compact form factor that fits comfortably in the hand.

## Firmware and Configuration

The gamepad runs on the GP2040-CE firmware, a highly regarded open-source project known for its low-latency performance and extensive feature set. One of the standout benefits of using GP2040-CE is the built-in local webserver. This allows users to configure button mappings, SOCD modes, and other system settings through a convenient Web-UI, accessible directly from a browser while the device is in configuration mode.

Because the device identifies as a standard USB HID (Human Interface Device), it is compatible with virtually any operating system that supports USB controllers, including Android, iOS, and various desktop platforms. This makes it a versatile tool for mobile emulation and native mobile games that support external controllers.

## Getting Started

The repository provides the necessary CAD files for the enclosure and the PCB design files. Users interested in building their own gamepad will need to:

1.  **Fabricate the PCB**: Use the provided design files in the `PCB` directory to order or manufacture the circuit board.
2.  **3D Print the Case**: Utilize the files in the `CAD` directory to print the housing and buttons.
3.  **Assembly**: Solder the components to the PCB and assemble the 3D-printed parts.
4.  **Firmware Installation**: Flash the RP2040 with the GP2040-CE firmware and use the provided configuration files to set up the initial button mapping.

This project serves as an excellent example of how hobbyists can create professional-grade, specialized gaming peripherals using open-source firmware and modern rapid prototyping tools.
