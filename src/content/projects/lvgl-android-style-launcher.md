## Overview

Launcher_lvgl is a sophisticated desktop launcher interface designed for embedded systems, heavily inspired by the Android user interface aesthetic. Developed using the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) version 7, this project demonstrates how to create a modern, fluid, and visually appealing human-machine interface (HMI) for resource-constrained hardware.

One of the project's key strengths is its cross-platform compatibility. By leveraging the QT platform as a wrapper, the launcher can be developed and simulated on standard Linux desktop environments before being deployed to ARM-based embedded hardware. This workflow significantly accelerates UI development and debugging.

## Key Features

The launcher provides a comprehensive suite of desktop components and applications typical of a modern smart device:

- **Android-Style UI**: Features a familiar layout with app icons, status indicators, and smooth transitions.
- **Integrated Widgets**: Includes a functional calendar application (`app_calendar.c`) and a sophisticated analog clock display composed of multiple layers (background, hour, minute, and second hands).
- **Custom Assets**: The project utilizes custom icon fonts (`IconFont12.c`) and high-resolution image assets converted to C arrays for efficient rendering on embedded displays.
- **FOC Interface**: Interestingly, the project includes an application for Field Oriented Control (`app_foc.c`), suggesting its utility in motor control interfaces or industrial dashboards.
- **Navigation Controls**: Implements standard navigation keys such as Home, Back, and Tool/Settings buttons to facilitate user interaction.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built on LVGL V7, utilizing its object-oriented C API to manage complex screen hierarchies. The source code reveals a modular structure where different functional areas (like the calendar or the motor control interface) are separated into dedicated application files. 

Large graphical assets, such as the background images (`night.c`, `girl.c`) and clock components, are pre-processed into C arrays. This is a common technique in embedded systems to avoid the overhead of filesystem access and image decoding at runtime, ensuring the UI remains responsive even on modest ARM processors.

## Target Platforms

While the project is demonstrated on a QT-based simulator, it is specifically optimized for:
- **Embedded Linux**: Running on SoCs like those from NXP, ST, or Rockchip.
- **ARM Bare-metal/RTOS**: Can be ported to high-performance microcontrollers capable of driving color displays.
- **Desktop Simulation**: Useful for UI designers to iterate on the look and feel without needing physical hardware present.

## Getting Started

To explore the project, developers typically need a working LVGL environment. Since it is based on the QT platform, you can open the project in QT Creator to run it on a PC. For hardware deployment, the LVGL drivers for your specific display and input device (touchscreen or keys) must be configured to point to the `launcher.c` entry point.
