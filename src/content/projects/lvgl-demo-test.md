LVGL-DemoTest is a specialized repository designed to showcase the capabilities of the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL), specifically focusing on version 7. LVGL is a widely-used open-source graphics library in the embedded industry, known for its ability to create sophisticated user interfaces with low memory footprints on microcontrollers.

This project serves as a practical implementation example, allowing developers to see how various UI elements—such as buttons, charts, sliders, and lists—behave in a real-world scenario. By providing a pre-configured environment with LVGL v7, it simplifies the initial setup process for developers looking to evaluate the library's performance and visual quality on their specific hardware targets.

The repository includes the core LVGL v7 source files, making it a self-contained demonstration. While the documentation within the repository is minimal, the primary visual evidence of the project's output is provided via a demonstration video, which illustrates the fluid animations and high-quality rendering achievable with the library. This is particularly useful for developers who want to see the library in action before integrating it into their own firmware.

For embedded developers, projects like LVGL-DemoTest are essential for benchmarking display drivers and ensuring that the graphics stack is correctly integrated with the underlying hardware abstraction layer (HAL). Whether targeting an STM32, ESP32, or another popular MCU, this demo provides a baseline for UI development and testing. It allows for the verification of color depth configurations, display refreshing logic, and input device (touchscreen) integration within the LVGL framework.
