The stm-start repository serves as a foundational guide for developers looking to transition from high-level frameworks like mbed to more direct hardware manipulation on the STM32 platform. Specifically targeting the Arch Max board—a development platform featuring the STM32F407 microcontroller—this project provides the necessary scaffolding to compile C programs that interact directly with the hardware registers as described in the ST reference manuals.

## Two Paths to Firmware Development

The project explores two distinct methodologies for ARM Cortex-M development: libopencm3 and CMSIS. By providing side-by-side examples, it allows developers to compare the ergonomics and overhead of each approach.

### libopencm3
The project highlights libopencm3 as a preferred open-source library that provides a hardware abstraction layer for a wide range of Cortex-M microcontrollers. In this repository, libopencm3 is used to handle the heavy lifting of the startup process. The provided examples demonstrate how to use an AWK script to generate linker scripts and C flags tailored to the specific device.

The boot sequence in the libopencm3 example is handled by a minimal vector implementation that performs essential tasks such as clearing the BSS, aligning the stack, and enabling the Floating Point Unit (FPU) before jumping to the user's main function. One notable detail is that the clocks are left in their reset state by default, requiring the developer to explicitly configure them—such as setting the High-Speed External (HSE) oscillator to 168MHz for the Arch Max using the provided setup functions.

### CMSIS
For those who prefer the industry-standard Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS), the project provides a path using files extracted from the mbed-os repository. This approach is more manual and closer to the metal, involving:

- A chip-specific startup assembly file (.S) that defines the Reset_Handler.
- A linker script (.ld) that defines the memory layout and section placement.
- A SystemInit implementation to configure the system clock and basic hardware.

The CMSIS example includes a "light" version of the system initialization code that removes dependencies on the full ST HAL library, offering a leaner alternative for developers who want to minimize code bloat and understand the exact sequence of register writes required to bring the chip online.

## Tooling and Debugging Workflow

A significant portion of the project is dedicated to the development environment. It assumes a standard ARM GCC toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc) and utilizes OpenOCD for hardware communication. The repository includes a specialized GDB script, load.gdb, which streamlines the "code-flash-debug" cycle. By running the debugger with this script, the system automatically connects to the OpenOCD server, resets the target board, and loads the ELF binary into the microcontroller's memory.

This setup allows for immediate execution or step-through debugging, providing a professional-grade workflow for embedded C development on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

## Hardware Interaction: The Blinky Example

Both the CMSIS and libopencm3 examples culminate in a "Blinky" application. On the Arch Max board, this involves toggling GPIO pin B3, which is connected to an LED near the ethernet port. The project includes Makefiles that handle the compilation of ELF files for debugging and the generation of raw binary files using objcopy for traditional flashing. 

By providing clear, documented entry points into STM32 development, stm-start acts as a bridge for developers moving from "black box" environments to a deeper, more granular understanding of the ARM Cortex-M architecture and the STM32 peripheral set.
