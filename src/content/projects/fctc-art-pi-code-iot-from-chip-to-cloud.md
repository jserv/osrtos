## Overview

FCTC-ART-Pi-Code is a comprehensive repository designed to guide developers through the journey of building IoT applications from the ground up—starting from the silicon and reaching into the cloud. The project centers on the **ART-Pi**, a high-performance development board powered by the STM32H750 micro-controller and the RT-Thread real-time operating system. 

This repository serves as a practical companion for learning embedded IoT development, providing a structured set of firmware examples that progress from basic hardware control to complex cloud-integrated systems.

## Hardware and Platform

The project targets the ART-Pi, which is the official development board of the RT-Thread community. It features an STM32H750XBH6 SoC, offering high-speed processing capabilities suitable for demanding tasks like graphical user interfaces and complex network stacks. The examples leverage various onboard peripherals, including:

- **Connectivity**: Onboard WiFi for internet access.
- **Storage**: SD card slots and SPI Flash for persistent data storage.
- **Display**: Support for LCD screens to run graphical interfaces.
- **Industrial Interfaces**: RS-232 and RS-485 for industrial sensor integration.

## Firmware Examples

The repository is organized into several chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of embedded systems development:

- **Basic Peripherals**: Initial examples cover standard "Hello World" routines and GPIO (Pin) device operations to familiarize users with the RT-Thread device driver model.
- **Sensor Integration**: Demonstrations of data acquisition from various sensors, including those using standard serial protocols like RS-232.
- **Industrial Protocols**: Implementation of RS-485 communication using the Modbus protocol, essential for industrial automation and remote monitoring.
- **Data Management**: Examples showing how to implement file systems on SD cards and SPI Flash, enabling data logging and configuration storage.
- **User Interface**: Integration of the **LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) to create modern, responsive graphical user interfaces on embedded displays.
- **Networking and Cloud**: Advanced examples covering WiFi connectivity, HTTP client/server implementations, and MQTT protocols to connect the device to the Alibaba Cloud (Aliyun) IoT platform.
- **System Maintenance**: A dedicated OTA (Over-the-Air) bootloader project is included to demonstrate how to perform remote firmware updates safely.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built upon the **RT-Thread RTOS**, utilizing its modular architecture and extensive software package ecosystem. By using the RT-Thread device framework, the code remains portable and follows a consistent API for interacting with different hardware components. The inclusion of networking stacks and middleware like Modbus and LVGL showcases the power of using a full-featured RTOS for modern IoT development, where multitasking and protocol handling are critical.
