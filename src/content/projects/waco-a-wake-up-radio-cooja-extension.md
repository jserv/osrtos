## Overview

Radio communication is the primary driver of battery consumption in wireless embedded systems. While modern MAC protocols have significantly improved device lifetimes, artifacts like idle listening still dominate the energy budget in low-data-rate applications. **WaCo** (Wake-Up Radio COOJA Extension) addresses this challenge by providing a simulation framework for Wake-Up Radios (WuR).

A Wake-Up Radio is a secondary, extremely low-power radio component that remains always-on. Because it consumes orders of magnitude less power than a standard transceiver, it can be used to listen for a specific trigger signal. Once detected, this trigger wakes up the primary, higher-power radio (such as a CC2420) for data communication. WaCo allows researchers and developers to explore these protocols within the Contiki OS and COOJA simulation environments.

## Key Features

WaCo integrates directly into the Contiki networking stack, offering several specialized components for WuR research:

- **WuRRDC MAC Module**: Located at `core/net/mac/wurrdc.c`, this module uses the WuR as a trigger for the standard CC2420 radio. It maintains the same interface as other Contiki MAC protocols, allowing it to sit transparently below standard routing protocols like RPL or Contiki Collect.
- **Accurate Power Profiling**: The extension enhances COOJA's power tracker to record time spent in different states for both the primary and secondary radios independently.
- **Unified Timeline Visualization**: Provides a visual representation of network behavior, showing events generated by both radio transceivers on a single timeline for easier debugging and analysis.
- **Platform Support**: Currently optimized for the Tmote Sky platform, utilizing the Unit Disk Graph Medium (UDGM) with constant loss for the radio channel model.

## Technical Implementation

WaCo is built as an extension to the Contiki OS source tree. It leverages the existing Rime and uIP stacks while introducing a dual-radio abstraction. The primary radio handles general data transfer, while the custom WuR module acts as the secondary trigger. By implementing the WuR logic within the COOJA simulator, WaCo enables the evaluation of multi-hop wireless sensor networks without requiring specialized hardware for initial protocol development.

The project was developed through a collaboration between the E3DA group at Fondazione Bruno Kessler and the D3S group at the University of Trento. It has been featured in several academic publications, including the 14th International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN).

## Getting Started

To use WaCo, users should have a basic understanding of Contiki OS and the COOJA simulation environment. The repository includes submodules that must be initialized to provide the full environment. 

Compiling for the Tmote Sky platform is handled via the standard Contiki make system. For example, navigating to `examples/waco` and running `make` will generate the necessary binaries. Once compiled, users can run included simulation files (such as `runicast.csc`) within COOJA to observe the Wake-Up Radio behavior in a virtual network.
