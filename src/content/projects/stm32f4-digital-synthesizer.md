## Overview

The STM32F4 Digital Synthesizer is a firmware project designed to transform an STM32F407VET6 development board into a versatile sound generation engine. By leveraging the high-speed processing capabilities of the ARM Cortex-M4 core, the project implements a polyphonic synthesizer capable of generating ten simultaneous voices. It is designed to be used either as a standalone instrument with a touch-panel interface or as a sound module controlled by an external microcontroller via SPI.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The synthesizer provides a robust set of sound-shaping tools typical of subtractive synthesis. It generates four standard waveforms—sine, square, sawtooth, and triangle—and can play up to ten instances of these sounds at once. 

**Key synthesis features include:**
- **Polyphony:** 10-voice simultaneous playback.
- **Filtering:** A built-in low-pass filter with adjustable cutoff frequency and Q (resonance) values.
- **Modulation:** Support for Tremolo, Vibrato, and WOW effects to add movement to the sound.
- **Envelope Shaping:** Full ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) controls for amplitude management.
- **Audio Output:** Direct waveform output via the STM32's internal Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC).

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using the STM32CubeIDE environment and utilizes the STM32 HAL and ARM CMSIS libraries for hardware abstraction and signal processing. A significant portion of the hardware configuration is managed through FSMC (Flexible Static Memory Controller) to drive an ILI9341 display with a touch panel, providing a visual interface for parameter adjustment.

For audio generation, the system uses Timer 6 (TIM6) to trigger the DAC at a consistent sample rate, often assisted by DMA to ensure glitch-free audio playback. The project also integrates the STMicroelectronics X-CUBE-ALGOBUILD DSP library to handle complex mathematical operations required for real-time filtering and modulation.

## External Control and Integration

One of the standout features of this synthesizer is its external control scheme. It is designed to act as a peripheral to a master controller (such as an Arduino or another MCU) via SPI. This allows developers to create innovative musical interfaces—like custom MIDI controllers or unique sensors—and use the STM32 project as the dedicated sound engine.

When using SPI control, the project supports speeds up to approximately 1MHz. The communication protocol allows the master device to update parameters such as pitch, filter settings, and envelope timings in real-time. The repository includes sample code for an Arduino Nano to demonstrate how to interface with the synthesizer module.

## Development and Setup

The project is optimized for the "STM32F407VET6 Black" board. Because the project relies on specific ARM CMSIS and ST libraries, the author recommends using the provided `.ioc` (STM32CubeMX configuration) file to initialize the environment within STM32CubeIDE. This ensures that all peripheral mappings for the FSMC display, SPI ports, and DAC are correctly configured for the target hardware.
