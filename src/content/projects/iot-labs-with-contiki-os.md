The IoT-Labs repository is a comprehensive collection of academic exercises and coursework focused on the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Developed primarily in C, these labs leverage the Contiki operating system, a popular open-source OS specifically designed for the Internet of Things, targeting low-power wireless devices.

### Simulation and Development Environment

Central to these labs is the use of Cooja, the Contiki network simulator. Cooja allows developers to simulate networks of sensors (motes) without requiring physical hardware for every test iteration. This environment is crucial for testing routing protocols, data aggregation strategies, and network topology behaviors in a controlled, reproducible manner. By using Cooja, the project demonstrates how to bridge the gap between high-level network logic and low-level embedded constraints.

### Key Areas of Focus

The repository is organized into several sections, labeled S1 through S8, representing sequential stages of a curriculum. Based on the project documentation and reports, significant emphasis is placed on data aggregation techniques. Data aggregation is a critical component in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to reduce the amount of data transmitted, thereby conserving energy and extending the battery life of remote nodes.

Two specific aggregation methods highlighted in the project reports include:

- **4-into-1 Aggregation**: A technique where data from four distinct sources or time intervals is condensed into a single transmission packet to minimize radio duty cycles.
- **SAX (Symbolic Aggregate Approximation) Aggregation**: A method used to represent time-series data as a sequence of symbols, allowing for efficient storage and comparison of sensor data patterns while reducing the communication overhead.

### Technical Implementation

The projects are implemented in C, following the event-driven programming model characteristic of Contiki. This involves defining processes and handling events such as timer expirations or packet receptions. The repository includes coursework reports that detail the findings and performance metrics of these implementations, providing insight into the practical challenges of IoT network optimization, such as balancing data accuracy with energy consumption.

Whether exploring basic connectivity or advanced data reduction algorithms, this repository serves as a practical guide for understanding the intersection of embedded systems, wireless communication, and data science within the IoT ecosystem.
