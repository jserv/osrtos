As urban environments become increasingly digitized, the concept of the 'Smart City' relies heavily on the seamless integration of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and intelligent data processing. The **AI-for-Smart-Cities** project provides a robust framework for addressing several critical challenges in this domain, ranging from network security and anomaly detection to the management of crowdsourced tasks.

### Intelligent Solutions for Urban Infrastructure

This project is organized into several specialized modules, each targeting a specific pain point in smart city management. By combining embedded systems development with high-level machine learning, it bridges the gap between raw sensor data and actionable intelligence.

### Wireless Sensor Networks and Contiki-NG

A core component of the project is the simulation and management of Wireless Sensor Networks. Using the **Contiki-NG** RTOS, the project simulates environments where sensors are randomly distributed to monitor parameters like temperature, humidity, and pressure. These sensors transmit data to a central controller at regular intervals. 

The project implements a mathematical approach to estimate environmental parameters (Theta), ensuring that the controller can provide a predicted value that accurately reflects the current state of the city's environment. The implementation includes C-based source files for sensors and controllers, managed via standard Contiki Makefiles:

```c
// Example of the project structure for WSN nodes
CONTIKI_PROJECT = mysensor mycontroller
all: $(CONTIKI_PROJECT)
PROJECT_SOURCEFILES += sensor.c
CONTIKI = ../..
include $(CONTIKI)/Makefile.include
```

### Network Simulation and Attack Detection

Security is paramount in smart city infrastructure. This repository includes a dedicated module for simulating network behavior under both normal and adversarial conditions. Using the Cooja simulator within the Contiki-NG ecosystem, the project models various network attacks. 

To distinguish between legitimate traffic and malicious activity, the project employs multi-classification machine learning techniques. Interestingly, the **Naive Bayes classifier** was found to perform the best in this specific context, outperforming other popular algorithms like Random Forest and AdaBoost. This highlights the importance of selecting the right model for resource-constrained IoT environments.

### Detecting Fake Tasks and Anomalies

Beyond network-level security, the project addresses data integrity through:

*   **Fake Task Detection**: In Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) scenarios, detecting fraudulent or 'fake' tasks is essential. The project uses binary classification with classic and ensemble machine learning algorithms to filter out unreliable data sources.
*   **Sensing Data Anomaly Detection**: By combining K-Means and One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM), the system can identify outliers in sensor data. This is achieved by establishing thresholds that classify data within certain intervals as anomalies, which is crucial for identifying sensor failures or environmental emergencies.

### Stochastic Task Generation

To test these systems, the project includes a stochastic algorithm for generating tasks and user movement events. This allows developers to simulate the dynamic nature of a city, where users and tasks appear and move in unpredictable patterns. This simulation is supported by Python scripts like `crowdsensim2.py` and `ZFMTasks.py`, providing a realistic testbed for the AI models.

### Technical Stack

The project is a multi-disciplinary effort involving:
*   **Embedded OS**: Contiki-NG for low-power wireless communication simulation.
*   **Simulation Tools**: Cooja and NS-3 (implied by Wifi Topology scripts).
*   **Machine Learning**: Python-based analysis using Scikit-Learn for SVM, K-Means, and Naive Bayes.
*   **Data Formats**: PCAP files for network traffic analysis and CSV for sensor data logs.

By integrating these technologies, AI-for-Smart-Cities offers a comprehensive look at how modern AI can protect and optimize the infrastructure of tomorrow's urban centers.
