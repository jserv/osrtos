## Overview

The Mbed OS Client Example is a legacy project designed to demonstrate how embedded devices running Mbed OS can connect to the Mbed Device Connector service. Although this repository is now deprecated in favor of the Pelion Device Management ecosystem, it remains a significant reference for understanding the integration of the Mbed Client library with various hardware platforms and network stacks.

The application serves as a template for creating LwM2M (Lightweight Machine to Machine) endpoints. It allows devices to register with a cloud service, expose resources for remote observation or control, and handle secure communication using Mbed TLS.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built around a `SimpleClient` wrapper class, which abstracts the complexities of the Mbed Client C++ API. This wrapper manages the lifecycle of the device connection, including:

- **Interface Creation**: Initializing the network interface (Ethernet, WiFi, or Mesh) and the LwM2M stack.
- **Security Management**: Handling certificates and keys required for DTLS/TLS connections to the server.
- **Resource Mapping**: Creating and managing M2MObject, M2MObjectInstance, and M2MResource instances that represent device data like sensors or actuators.
- **Callback Handling**: Implementing the `M2MInterfaceObserver` interface to respond to registration events, value updates from the server, and network errors.

## Connectivity and Hardware Support

One of the strengths of this example is its broad support for different connectivity methods and hardware targets. The build configuration, managed via `mbed_app.json`, allows the application to be compiled for various scenarios:

- **Ethernet**: Standard wired connectivity for boards like the NXP FRDM-K64F or ST Nucleo-F429ZI.
- **WiFi**: Support for modules such as the ESP8266, Inventek ISM43362 (on DISCO_L475VG_IOT01A), and u-blox ODIN-W2.
- **Mesh Networking**: Integration with Nanostack for 6LoWPAN (Sub-GHz or 2.4GHz) and Thread protocols.
- **Cellular**: Support for PPP-based cellular connections on specific targets.

## Configuration and Security

The project utilizes several configuration headers to fine-tune the client's behavior. `mbed_client_config.h` defines parameters like reconnection intervals, TCP keep-alive times, and CoAP message sizes. Security is handled through a `security.h` file (typically generated by the Mbed Device Connector portal), which contains the endpoint name, domain, and the necessary certificates for authentication.

For resource-constrained devices, the `mbedtls_mbed_client_config.h` file provides a minimal, optimized configuration for Mbed TLS. It selectively enables only the necessary cryptographic suites (like ECDHE-ECDSA with AES-GCM) to save ROM and RAM while maintaining robust security.

## Legacy Status

Users should note that the Mbed Device Connector service was deprecated in 2018. For modern development, ARM recommends transitioning to the [mbed-cloud-client-example](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cloud-client-example) and the Pelion Device Management service. However, this repository remains a valuable resource for developers maintaining older Mbed OS 5 systems or those looking for a clear example of LwM2M implementation in C++.
