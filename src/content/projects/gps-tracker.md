The GPS-Tracker project is a comprehensive embedded systems initiative aimed at developing a standalone device for geospatial positioning. Currently in its development phase, the project bridges the gap between custom hardware engineering and firmware implementation.

### Hardware Design

One of the central components of this project is its custom PCB. The repository includes detailed visual documentation of the hardware, showing a compact and integrated circuit board. The design appears to prioritize a small footprint, which is essential for portable tracking applications. Based on the hardware images provided in the project documentation, the device incorporates a microcontroller unit (MCU) interfaced with a GPS module to receive satellite signals, along with necessary power management circuitry for mobile operation.

### Software Architecture

The project is organized into distinct hardware and software directories. This separation allows for modular development of the firmware that drives the tracking logic. The software component is responsible for interfacing with the GPS hardware, parsing NMEA sentences or proprietary binary protocols, and managing the device's state. While the project is marked as "in progress," the structure suggests a focus on creating a robust software stack to handle GPS data acquisition and potentially data transmission or local logging.

### Project Status and Goals

As an active development project, GPS-Tracker serves as a practical example of building a specialized IoT device from the ground up. The combination of custom PCB design and dedicated software makes it a versatile platform for various tracking needs, from asset management to personal navigation tools. The project demonstrates the full lifecycle of embedded development, from schematic and PCB layout to firmware integration.
