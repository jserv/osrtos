## Reviving Vintage Horology with Modern Electronics

The Old Train Station Clock project is a creative bridge between industrial-era mechanical engineering and modern IoT technology. Many vintage station clocks utilize a simple two-step stepping motor with an escapement mechanism that requires a specific electrical signal to advance: a 24V DC pulse that alternates polarization every minute. Traditionally, this was handled by a master clock system, but this project replaces that bulky infrastructure with a compact ESP32-C3 and a common 3D printer component.

## The Hardware Hack: Stepper Drivers as H-Bridges

The core technical challenge of driving these clocks is the need for alternating polarization. While a custom H-bridge circuit could be built from discrete transistors, this project utilizes a clever shortcut: the A4988 or DRV8825 stepper motor driver. These modules, ubiquitous in the 3D printing community, contain two integrated H-bridges and all necessary safety features like over-current protection and thermal shutdown.

By treating the clock's single coil as one phase of a stepper motor, the driver can be commanded to "step," which naturally alternates the output polarization. This approach simplifies the bill of materials and provides a robust, reliable driving stage for the 24V clock mechanism.

## Intelligent Software with MicroPython

The project is powered by MicroPython running on an ESP32-C3 Mini. This choice allows for rapid development and high-level features that would be more complex in C++, such as easy JSON parsing for configuration and simple HTTP requests for time synchronization.

**Key Software Features include:**
- **Online Synchronization:** The clock connects to WiFi and uses the WorldTimeAPI to synchronize its internal Real-Time Clock (RTC) every hour.
- **Persistent State:** To ensure the clock remains accurate after a power cycle, the current position of the hands is stored in a `configuration.json` file on the internal flash memory.
- **Energy Efficiency:** The stepper driver is only enabled during the actual "tick" (the polarization switch) and is disabled immediately after to prevent unnecessary power consumption and coil heating.

## Interactive Management

One of the standout features of this implementation is the interactive serial console. When connected via USB, users can interact with the clock in real-time. The console provides an ASCII art representation of the current time and allows for various commands:

```
s, status     - Show current clock status with ASCII clock
t HH:MM       - Set displayed time (e.g., t 14:30)
+N            - Physically advance clock by N minutes
sync          - Force RTC synchronization with online service
run           - Start automatic clock mode
```

This interface makes it easy to calibrate the physical hands with the digital logic without needing to reflash the firmware or manually edit files. 

## Technical Implementation Details

The wiring is straightforward, utilizing three GPIO pins from the ESP32-C3: one for the driver's `ENABLE` pin, one for the `STEP` pin, and one for an status LED. The system uses a step-down converter (like the LM2596) to provide 5V to the ESP32 from the 24V rail required by the clock motor. This creates a self-contained unit that only needs a single power source to keep perfect time for years to come.
