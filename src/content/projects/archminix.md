summary: ArchMinix is a specialized project focused on porting the Texas Instruments
  TMS320C6678 (C6678) Board Support Package (BSP) to the RTEMS 4.11 real-time operating
  system. It provides essential system components including libcpu for C6x DSP support,
  networking drivers, a dynamic loader, and a consolidated C library merging Newlib
  with TI's proprietary RTS library.

ArchMinix represents a significant effort to bridge the gap between high-performance Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) and robust real-time operating systems. Specifically, this project focuses on porting the Board Support Package (BSP) for the Texas Instruments TMS320C6678 into the master branch of RTEMS 4.11. By partitioning source files into logical sub-folders, the project aims to provide a clean, modular foundation for developers working with C6x architecture.

## The Core Architecture

The repository is structured to handle the complexities of the C6678 platform by breaking down the system into several critical libraries:

- **libcpu**: Provides the necessary low-level support for the C6x DSP architecture.
- **libbsp**: Contains the board-specific logic for the C6678 platform.
- **librtems**: The core RTOS support layer.
- **libc**: A unique implementation that consolidates RTEMS's standard Newlib with TI Code Composer Studio's (CCS) own C library, known as `rts`.

## Comprehensive BSP Features

ArchMinix is more than just a basic port; it includes a full suite of drivers and system services required for production-grade embedded development. The BSP implementation covers:

- **Boot & Clock**: Essential initialization and timing services.
- **Console & Timer**: Standard I/O and hardware timer management.
- **Network**: Support for networking stacks, including various Ethernet chip drivers like the CS8900, SMC91111, and DWMAC.
- **Flash**: Drivers for non-volatile storage management.
- **Dynamic Loader**: A sophisticated feature that allows for more flexible application management on the DSP.

## Hardware and Toolchain Support

The primary target for this project is the TI C6678, a high-performance multicore DSP. To build the project, developers are encouraged to use the TI CCS (Code Composer Studio) toolchain specifically designed for C6x platforms. This ensures compatibility with TI's proprietary optimizations while benefiting from the open-source RTEMS ecosystem.

## A Foundation for Future Ports

One of the most valuable aspects of ArchMinix is its potential as a reference implementation. The author has organized the source code such that it can serve as a starting point for developers looking to port the C6678 BSP to other popular RTOSes, such as RT-Thread, FreeRTOS, or Zephyr. By providing a working implementation on RTEMS, it clarifies the hardware abstraction requirements for the C6x architecture.

## Getting Started

To work with ArchMinix, you will need the TI CCS toolchain. The repository includes a variety of application examples, such as a network initialization app and a 'ticker' system task example, which demonstrate how to initialize the system and manage tasks within the RTEMS environment. For instance, the `apps/ticker` directory provides a clear look at how system headers and task definitions are structured in this environment.
