## Overview

RT-Thread Smart (rt-smart) is an open-source microkernel operating system that brings the benefits of a traditional RTOS together with the advanced memory management capabilities of a microkernel. This project focuses on porting rt-smart to the RISC-V architecture, specifically targeting the QEMU emulator and the Kendryte K210 SoC. 

While many RISC-V operating systems are currently available, few provide robust support for Memory Management Units (MMU). This project addresses that gap by implementing the MMU virtual memory mechanism on RISC-V, allowing for a clear separation between kernel space (Supervisor mode) and user space (User mode).

## Key Features and Technical Specifications

The porting effort emphasizes compatibility and standard-compliant interfaces to ensure a smooth development experience for embedded software engineers. Key technical features include:

- **POSIX Subset Support**: The system call interface is designed to support a subset of the POSIX standard, facilitating the porting of existing Linux/Unix applications.
- **Musl Libc Integration**: The project utilizes musl libc, a lightweight and efficient C library, to provide standard library functions for user-space applications.
- **RISC-V Architecture**: Full support for RISC-V platforms, leveraging the architecture's S-mode (Supervisor) for the kernel and U-mode (User) for applications.
- **MMU Virtual Memory**: Implementation of virtual memory management to provide process isolation and memory protection.

## Target Platforms

The project targets two primary environments for development and deployment:

### QEMU Simulation
The initial phase of the project involves porting rt-smart to the QEMU RISC-V emulator. This requires adapting the kernel to handle QEMU's virtual UART and timer hardware. This environment serves as a critical testing ground for the musl libc interface and core kernel functionality before moving to physical hardware.

### Kendryte K210
The primary hardware target is the Kendryte K210, a dual-core RISC-V SoC. The porting effort for the K210 includes:
- **Basic Porting**: Implementing MMU support and ensuring the system runs in S-mode while user programs run in U-mode.
- **Peripheral Drivers**: Extending the system to support hardware-specific features such as GPIO, SPI, and SPI Flash.
- **File System Support**: Mounting readable and writable file systems to allow for persistent storage and user program downloads.

## Project Context

This repository was developed as part of the "OS Function Design" track for the 2021 National Undergraduate Operating System Competition. It serves as a comprehensive example of how to bring modern OS features like virtual memory and process isolation to resource-constrained RISC-V hardware, bridging the gap between traditional RTOS and full-scale GPOS like Linux.
