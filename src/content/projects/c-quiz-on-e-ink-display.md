## Overview

Learning C++ can be a daunting task, but this project offers a unique way to stay sharp by bringing daily quiz questions from the popular [cppquiz.org](https://cppquiz.org/) directly to your desk via an E-Ink display. Powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, the system fetches questions from a managed Google Sheets backend and renders them with clean formatting on a high-contrast 7.5-inch electronic paper screen.

The project is designed for low power consumption and high reliability, ensuring that even if your Wi-Fi drops, you still have a question to ponder thanks to local caching mechanisms.

## Technical Architecture

The system architecture is split between a cloud-based backend and the embedded firmware. 

### The Backend: Google Sheets & Apps Script
Because the source website provides questions in a large bulk JSON format rather than a granular API, this project uses a Google Sheets spreadsheet as an intermediary database. A Google Apps Script acts as the API endpoint for the ESP32. When the device requests a question, the script:
1. Scans the sheet for the next unshown question.
2. Marks the question as "shown" to prevent immediate repetition.
3. Returns the question text, ID, and difficulty level as a plain text response.

### The Firmware: ESP32 & Arduino
The firmware is built using the Arduino framework on the ESP32 platform. It handles the Wi-Fi connection, HTTP requests to the Google Script, and the complex rendering required for E-Ink displays. A key feature of the firmware is its power management; the device utilizes the ESP32's deep sleep mode, waking up only once per hour to check for updates, which significantly extends battery life.

## Hardware Components

To build this device, you need:
- **Waveshare ESP32 E-Paper Driver Board**: Provides the processing power and the specific interface logic for E-Ink panels.
- **Waveshare 7.5" E-Paper Display**: Offers a large, paper-like reading experience that remains visible without power.
- **3D Printed Case**: While optional, the project is designed to fit into various online 3D-printable frames available for these specific screen sizes.

## Key Features

- **Offline Resilience**: If the Wi-Fi connection fails during a wake cycle, the ESP32 automatically loads and displays the last successfully cached question from its internal memory.
- **Status Indicators**: The display includes a Wi-Fi status icon, letting the user know if the current question was freshly fetched or pulled from the cache.
- **Configuration Mode**: If Wi-Fi credentials are missing or connection fails, the device can create its own Access Point (AP), allowing users to configure settings via a web interface at `192.168.4.1`.
- **Deep Sleep**: The system is optimized for longevity, spending the vast majority of its time in a low-power state.

## Configuration

Users can customize the firmware by updating the `config.h` file with their specific Wi-Fi credentials and the Deployment ID generated from their Google Apps Script:

```cpp
const std::string wifi_ssid         = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
const std::string wifi_pwd          = "YOUR_WIFI_PWD";
const std::string gs_deployment_id  = "YOUR_GS_DEPLOYMENT_ID";
```

On the cloud side, the Google Apps Script handles the logic of iterating through the `questions.xlsx` data, ensuring a seamless flow of content to the device without requiring complex database hosting.
