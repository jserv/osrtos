title: LVGL for Android
summary: A framework for developing HMI on Android using C and the LVGL library without
  relying on the Java Android API. It allows developers to run applications directly
  from the command line, making it ideal for BSP and MCU engineers working on factory
  modes, self-tests, or fast-camera interfaces.

## Overview

LVGL for Android provides a unique pathway for embedded developers to create high-performance Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI) on Android-based hardware using pure C. By bypassing the standard Java-based Android API, this project allows HMI applications to run directly from the command line, offering a development experience that is much closer to traditional MCU or BSP workflows.

This project is specifically designed for engineers who are already familiar with the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) ecosystem and need to implement system-level interfaces such as factory test modes, self-test utilities, or fast-boot camera displays on Android platforms.

## Key Features

One of the primary advantages of this implementation is its simplicity and generic nature. By removing hardware-acceleration-specific code, the project remains highly portable across different Android hardware platforms. 

**Core capabilities include:**
- **Direct Input Support:** Integrated support for input devices like touchscreens via `evdev`, allowing users to interact with LVGL windows directly.
- **Alpha Channel Blending:** Support for alpha-channel transparency allows LVGL applications to be displayed over or under other Android applications with seamless blending.
- **Command-Line Execution:** Applications can be launched and run directly from the Android shell (cmdline), which is essential for low-level system debugging and early-stage development.
- **Simplified Porting:** The project uses a straightforward cross-compilation approach with CMake and the Android NDK, making it easy to adapt to specific toolchains.

## Technical Architecture

The project is based on LVGL 8.0.0 and is structured to be easily upgradable. It interfaces with the Android display system at a low level, treating the Android environment more like a standard Linux framebuffer or display device rather than a high-level application framework. 

For input handling, the project utilizes `evdev.cpp`, which can be modified to point to the specific input device nodes of the target platform. This direct access to `/dev/input/` nodes ensures low latency and avoids the overhead of the Android InputManager service.

## Getting Started

To use LVGL for Android, developers typically integrate the source into their Android project's external directory. The build process involves two main steps:

1. **Compiling the Library:** Using CMake and a cross-compile toolchain file tailored to the specific Android NDK, developers generate `liblvgl.a`.
2. **Building the Application:** The project includes demo applications that can be compiled using the standard Android `mmm` build command. These demos illustrate how to call LVGL APIs within the Android environment.

## Use Cases

This framework is particularly well-suited for specialized system applications where the full Android UI stack is either unavailable or unnecessary:
- **Factory Mode HMI:** Creating diagnostic tools used during device manufacturing.
- **Self-Test Utilities:** Developing low-level hardware verification software.
- **Fast-Camera HMI:** Implementing quick-boot camera interfaces that need to appear before the full Android OS has finished loading.
