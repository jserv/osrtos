## Overview

TinyOS-nesC is a repository dedicated to developing applications for the TelosB mote using the TinyOS operating system. TinyOS is a well-known component-based, event-driven operating system designed specifically for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in sensor networks. The applications in this repository are written in nesC, a dialect of C that supports the TinyOS component model.

## Hardware Platform: TelosB Mote

The primary target for these programs is the TelosB mote. This platform is a popular choice in the research community for wireless sensor networks (WSN). It is based on the MSP430 microcontroller and features an IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio, making it ideal for low-power communication and environmental monitoring tasks.

## Technical Environment and Tooling

Developing for TinyOS requires a specific toolchain that bridges high-level component descriptions with low-level hardware execution. This project provides a setup script, `tinyos.sh`, which automates the installation of the necessary dependencies on a Linux environment. Key components of the toolchain include:

- **nesCC**: The nesC compiler that translates component-based code into standard C code for the target microcontroller.
- **gcc-msp430**: The GNU compiler collection for the MSP430 architecture, used to compile the output from nesCC into binary format.
- **TinyOS Main**: The core TinyOS repository which provides the system-level components and hardware abstraction layers (HAL).
- **PySerial**: Used for communication between the host computer and the TelosB mote via USB.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate the development and deployment of sensor network applications:

- **apps/**: This directory contains the source code for various nesC applications. These typically include a configuration file (ending in `.nc`) that wires components together and a module file that implements the application logic.
- **tinyos.sh**: A comprehensive shell script that handles the installation of Java (OpenJDK 8), build essentials, and the TinyOS source tree, ensuring a consistent development environment.

## Getting Started

To use these programs, developers typically need to set up the TinyOS environment using the provided shell script. Once the environment is configured and the `TINYOS_ROOT` is set, applications can be compiled using the TinyOS build system (usually via `make telosb`). This process involves the nesC compiler analyzing the component graph, optimizing the code, and generating a firmware image that can be flashed onto the TelosB hardware.
