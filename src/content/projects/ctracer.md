### Introduction to ctracer

**ctracer** is a simple yet effective software tracer for C applications. Developed as a preparatory investigation for the [ERIKA Enterprise](http://www.erika-enterprise.com) RTOS, it provides a mechanism to record function execution flow and timing data with minimal overhead. The project draws heavy inspiration from the Linux kernel's `ftrace` mechanism, specifically utilizing compiler-level instrumentation to hook into function entries.

### How It Works

The tracer relies on the GCC `-pg` option, which instructs the compiler to insert calls to a profiling function (traditionally `mcount` or `__fentry__`) at the beginning of every function. `ctracer` provides its own implementation of these hooks, allowing it to intercept execution and log the instruction pointer and a high-resolution timestamp.

To handle the low-level requirements of function interception, the project includes assembly trampolines for both **x86_64** and **AArch64** architectures. These trampolines ensure that the CPU state is preserved while the tracer records the necessary data, making it compatible with modern 64-bit systems.

### Getting Started

Using `ctracer` is straightforward. The build system is managed via a simple Makefile that detects your architecture and applies the necessary flags, such as `-mfentry` on x86_64 systems.

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
make
```

Running the resulting executable generates a binary trace file:

```bash
./main
```

This produces a file named `trace.dat` containing raw addresses and timestamps. Because raw addresses aren't human-readable, the project provides a Python utility to resolve these addresses into function names using the symbol table of the executable:

```bash
./create_trace.py ./main trace.dat
```

This generates a `trace.txt` file detailing the sequence of function calls.

### Advanced Visualization with BTF

One of the most powerful features of `ctracer` is its support for the **Best Trace Format (BTF)**. By using the `create_trace_btf.py` script, users can convert their raw execution data into a format compatible with [Eclipse Trace Compass](https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/). 

This allows developers to move beyond simple text logs and utilize sophisticated graphical tools to visualize call stacks, analyze execution timing, and identify performance bottlenecks in their embedded software.

### Technical Details and Future Goals

The project is currently in a functional prototype stage. The current implementation focuses on function entry points. However, the project roadmap includes several significant enhancements:

*   **Exit Hijacking**: Modifying the trampoline to intercept function returns, allowing for precise measurement of function execution duration.
*   **RTOS Integration**: Porting the core logic to ERIKA Enterprise, a popular OSEK/VDX-certified RTOS for automotive and industrial applications.

By keeping the core logic simple and leveraging standard GCC features, `ctracer` serves as an excellent reference for anyone looking to implement custom software tracing in resource-constrained or real-time environments.
