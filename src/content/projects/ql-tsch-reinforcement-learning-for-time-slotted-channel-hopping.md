## Overview

QL-TSCH is a specialized implementation of the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) protocol that incorporates Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize network performance. Based on research specifications, this project extends the standard Contiki-OS MAC layer to support Q-Learning algorithms for scheduling and channel selection in IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor networks.

TSCH is a key component of the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, designed to provide high reliability and low power consumption in industrial IoT environments. QL-TSCH enhances this by allowing nodes to dynamically learn and adapt their communication patterns based on network conditions, reducing collisions and improving throughput.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built on the **Contiki-OS** framework, specifically leveraging its TSCH and RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) stacks. The core logic is implemented in C, with project-specific configurations defined to enable the QL-TSCH features within the system's MAC layer.

### Key Components

- **Node Implementation (`node.c`)**: The primary application logic for network motes, handling initialization and the networking stack setup.
- **MAC Layer Extensions**: The project modifies the standard TSCH behavior to include Q-value calculations and APT (Average Packet Transmission) tracking.
- **Simulation Environment**: Extensive support for the **Cooja** simulator is provided through `.csc` configuration files, allowing for the validation of the RL algorithm in virtualized environments.
- **Automation Tools**: A Python-based custom client (`custom-client-cooja.py`) is included to automate simulation runs, log analysis, and grid generation for testing different network topologies.

## Configuration and Features

The project provides granular control over the Q-Learning parameters and TSCH settings via `project-conf.h`. Key configurable features include:

- **QL-TSCH Activation**: Macros to enable or disable the QL-TSCH logic within the TSCH libraries.
- **Slotframe Management**: Configurable lengths for both broadcast and unicast slotframes (defaulting to 7 and 15 slots respectively).
- **Learning Parameters**: Options to initialize with random Q-values or zeros, and toggles for printing Q-values and APT values during runtime for analysis.
- **Security**: Optional support for IEEE 802.15.4 LLSEC security.
- **Hopping Sequences**: Support for various hopping sequences, including the standard `TSCH_HOPPING_SEQUENCE_2_2`.

## Simulation and Testing

Testing is primarily conducted using the Cooja simulator. The repository includes a `ql_tsch.csc` file which defines a simulation environment with multiple motes. The included Python script facilitates complex testing scenarios, such as:

- Generating grid, random, or "randgrid" topologies.
- Automating the cleanup of simulation logs and temporary build files.
- Monitoring RPL DODAG construction in real-time.
- Interfacing with the sink and source nodes via socket connections to simulate data traffic.

## Getting Started

To use this project, a working Contiki-OS environment is required. The `Makefile` is configured to include the standard Contiki build system. Users can compile the project for the Cooja target using:

```bash
make TARGET=cooja
```

Once compiled, the simulation can be loaded into Cooja, or the `custom-client-cooja.py` script can be used to run automated experiments. The project is particularly useful for researchers and engineers looking to explore the intersection of machine learning and low-power wireless networking.
