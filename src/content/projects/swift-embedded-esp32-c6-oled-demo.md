Embedded Swift is an emerging frontier for developers looking to bring the safety and expressiveness of the Swift programming language to resource-constrained environments. This project serves as a practical demonstration of Swift running on the ESP32-C6, specifically targeting the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6 expansion board. The demo features a real-time 3D graphics rendering of a rotating cube displayed on an OLED screen.

## Hardware and Platform

The project targets the ESP32-C6, a RISC-V based SoC from Espressif that supports modern wireless protocols like Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5, and Zigbee/Thread. By utilizing the XIAO ESP32-C6 expansion board, the project leverages an integrated OLED display via I2C communication. The underlying system relies on the ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework), which provides the FreeRTOS kernel and essential hardware abstraction layers.

## Graphics and Rendering

At the heart of the visual experience is the U8g2 library, a popular choice for monochrome displays in the embedded world. The project uses a Swift wrapper (U8g2Kit) to interface with the C-based U8g2 library. The 3D animation logic is implemented in Swift, demonstrating the language's ability to handle mathematical computations and frame-buffer manipulation efficiently enough for smooth animations on a microcontroller.

To keep the binary size manageable—a critical requirement for embedded systems—the project includes a guide on U8g2 font optimization. By extracting only the necessary font data into separate C files, developers can significantly reduce the memory footprint of the final firmware.

## Technical Integration

One of the most interesting aspects of this repository is the integration of the Swift Package Manager (SPM) with the CMake-based ESP-IDF build system. Since ESP-IDF does not natively support Swift, the project uses a custom CMake configuration to invoke the Swift toolchain. This process involves:

- Compiling Swift source code into a static library (`libApp.a`).
- Using a specific RISC-V triple (`riscv32-none-none-eabi`) for the Swift compiler.
- Enabling experimental embedded features in the Swift compiler to strip away the standard library overhead.
- Linking the resulting Swift archive with the rest of the ESP-IDF components.

## Swift and C Interoperability

The project highlights the seamless interoperability between Swift and C, which is vital for accessing ESP-IDF's extensive driver library. For instance, the code demonstrates how to call `i2c_driver_install` and other peripheral drivers directly from Swift. It also addresses common pitfalls, such as ensuring symbols are correctly referenced to prevent them from being stripped during the linking process.

## Getting Started

To build the project, developers need both the ESP-IDF environment and a Swift toolchain capable of cross-compiling for RISC-V. The workflow follows the standard ESP-IDF pattern using `idf.py` for configuration and flashing, while the Swift code is managed via `Package.swift` within the component directory. This setup provides a modern development experience, allowing for high-level application logic in Swift while maintaining low-level control through C and the FreeRTOS-based SDK.
