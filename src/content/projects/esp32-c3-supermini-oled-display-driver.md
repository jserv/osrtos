The ESP32-C3 Supermini is a compact and cost-effective development board based on the RISC-V architecture. While these boards are widely available on various platforms, they often arrive with little to no technical documentation, particularly regarding the integrated 0.42-inch OLED display. This project addresses those documentation gaps by providing the necessary pin configurations and software workarounds to get the display running efficiently.

## Hardware Specifications

The board features an OLED display with a resolution of 72x40 pixels. Communication is handled via the I2C protocol. According to the project's findings, the specific pin mapping for the I2C bus is as follows:

- **SDA**: GPIO 5 (often labeled as D6 on the board)
- **SCL**: GPIO 6 (often labeled as D5 on the board)
- **Resolution**: 72x40 pixels

## The U8g2 Library Workaround

A significant hurdle when using this hardware is that the standard U8g2 graphics library does not contain a dedicated constructor for a 72x40 resolution display. To solve this, the project utilizes a standard 128x64 SSD1306 constructor and applies a coordinate offset to align the graphics with the physical screen boundaries.

By defining an `xOffset` of 30 and a `yOffset` of 12, the 72x40 active area is centered within the 128x64 virtual buffer. This allows developers to use standard U8g2 drawing functions while ensuring the output is visible on the small 0.42-inch screen.

## Software Implementation

The project includes a complete Arduino sketch (`.ino`) that demonstrates the initialization and usage of the display. Key implementation details include:

- **Initialization**: Using the `U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C` constructor with hardware I2C.
- **Performance**: Setting the I2C bus clock to 400kHz for faster screen refreshes.
- **Visuals**: Setting the contrast to maximum to compensate for the small screen size.
- **Buffer Management**: Using the full frame buffer mode (`_F_`) for flicker-free updates.

```cpp
#include <U8g2lib.h>
#define OLED_RESET U8X8_PIN_NONE
#define OLED_SDA 5
#define OLED_SCL 6

// Workaround constructor
U8G2_SSD1306_128X64_NONAME_F_HW_I2C u8g2(U8G2_R0, OLED_RESET, OLED_SCL, OLED_SDA);

int xOffset = 30;  // Offset to center 72x40 display
int yOffset = 12;

void setup(void) {
  u8g2.begin();
  u8g2.setContrast(255);
  u8g2.setBusClock(400000);
}
```

This repository serves as an essential reference for developers working with the ESP32-C3 Supermini, transforming a poorly documented hardware module into a functional platform for IoT and wearable projects.
