## Overview

This project provides a robust port of FreeRTOS to the Renesas RH850 microcontroller family. While the RH850 is a powerful automotive-grade architecture, finding open-source RTOS ports can be challenging. This implementation specifically targets the G3K single-core chip (F1L) and focuses on leveraging architecture-specific instructions to maximize performance and minimize memory overhead.

## Advanced Architectural Optimizations

The port goes beyond a generic implementation by utilizing specific features of the RH850 G3K core. One of the most significant optimizations is the use of the `SCH1L` instruction for task selection. Similar to the `CLZ` (Count Leading Zeros) instruction found in ARM Cortex-M processors, this allows the RTOS to determine the highest priority ready task in a single operation, ensuring constant-time scheduling regardless of the number of tasks.

Interrupt handling has also been heavily optimized. The port supports full interrupt nesting, allowing high-priority hardware events to preempt lower-priority interrupt handlers. To keep the system responsive, the context saving mechanism is split: only scratch registers are saved and restored upon ISR entry and exit unless a context switch (preemption) is actually required. 

## Efficient Stack Management

A common challenge on the RH850 is the lack of a dedicated hardware interrupt stack. In many RTOS implementations, this forces developers to allocate enough space on every single task stack to handle the worst-case nested interrupt depth, which wastes significant RAM. 

This port solves the problem by implementing a software-managed interrupt stack. While the first level of an interrupt uses a small amount of the current task's stack, subsequent nested interrupts transition to the system stack. This approach significantly reduces the RAM requirements for multi-tasking applications without sacrificing the ability to handle complex interrupt hierarchies.

## Multi-Toolchain Support

Recognizing the diverse ecosystem of automotive and industrial development, the project supports four major toolchains:
- **GCC**: Using the v850-elf-gcc cross-compiler.
- **IAR**: Support for the IAR Embedded Workbench for Renesas RH850.
- **GHS**: Integration with Green Hills Software (GHS) Multi environment.
- **CCRH**: Support for the Renesas native CCRH compiler.

The build system is unified using CMake and Ninja, providing a modern development experience regardless of the underlying compiler. This makes it easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines or existing professional IDEs.

## Getting Started

The project includes a sample application to demonstrate the RTOS in action. Building the project typically involves setting the toolchain path in your environment and running a standard CMake configuration. For example, using GCC:

```bash
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE='cmake/gcc.cmake' -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -GNinja ..
$ ninja
```

Flash programming is supported via the Renesas Flash Programmer (RFP) CLI, allowing for a seamless "build and run" workflow from the command line.
