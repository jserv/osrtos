## Overview

MeinDataLogger is a firmware project designed for the Espressif ecosystem, specifically targeting the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers. Developed using the Arduino framework, this project provides a foundation for capturing and persisting data directly onto a device's internal flash memory. It is particularly useful for IoT applications where sensor data needs to be buffered or logged locally before being transmitted or analyzed.

## Core Functionality and Storage

The primary objective of MeinDataLogger is to facilitate reliable data storage in embedded environments. To achieve this, the project integrates with modern flash filesystems that handle the constraints of NAND flash memory:

- **LittleFS**: Used as the default filesystem for the ESP8266 (NodeMCU v2). LittleFS is designed specifically for microcontrollers, offering features like wear leveling to extend the life of the flash memory and resilience against data corruption during unexpected power failures.
- **SPIFFS**: The project configuration includes support for SPIFFS (Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System), which has traditionally been used for ESP32-based logging applications.

## Hardware Support

The repository is pre-configured to support popular development boards through PlatformIO environments:

- **NodeMCU v2**: A widely used ESP8266-based board, ideal for low-power IoT logging tasks due to its integrated WiFi and sufficient GPIOs.
- **ESP32-CAM**: The configuration includes provisions for the ESP32-CAM, suggesting the logger can be extended to handle camera-related data or more intensive processing tasks provided by the dual-core ESP32 architecture.

## Technical Configuration

The project is built using the **PlatformIO** ecosystem, which manages the complex build flags and environment settings required for different hardware targets. The `platformio.ini` configuration defines specific parameters to optimize the hardware performance:

- **High-Speed Communication**: Configured for 921600 baud upload speeds and 115200 baud serial monitoring to ensure efficient development cycles.
- **Flash Partitioning**: The project uses custom linker scripts (such as `eagle.flash.1m128.ld`) to define the memory layout, ensuring that the appropriate amount of space is allocated for the filesystem partition versus the application code.
- **Conditional Compilation**: Build flags like `-D FS_LITTLEFS` are utilized to conditionally compile the appropriate storage logic based on the target hardware.

## Project Structure

The repository follows a standard PlatformIO directory structure, ensuring a clean separation of concerns for embedded development:

- **src/**: Contains the main application logic and logging routines.
- **lib/**: Reserved for project-specific libraries or drivers.
- **data/**: A dedicated directory for files that need to be uploaded to the LittleFS or SPIFFS partition during the deployment process.
- **test/**: Provides a space for unit testing the logging logic and filesystem integrity.

This structured approach makes MeinDataLogger a solid starting point for developers looking to implement persistent data storage on Espressif hardware without the overhead of a full RTOS-based SDK, while still benefiting from the extensive Arduino library ecosystem.
