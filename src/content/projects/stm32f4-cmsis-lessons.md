## Overview

The STM32F4 CMSIS Lessons repository is a comprehensive educational resource designed for developers looking to master the STM32F4 series of microcontrollers using the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS). Unlike projects that rely on high-level abstraction layers like the STM32 HAL, these lessons focus on low-level register manipulation and standard ARM interfaces, providing a deeper understanding of how the hardware operates.

This project serves as the code companion to the "donRumata" YouTube channel, where each directory corresponds to specific video tutorials. It is an ideal starting point for students and engineers who want to move beyond library-dependent development and gain fine-grained control over their firmware.

## Key Learning Modules

The repository is organized into several focused directories, each targeting a specific peripheral or concept within the STM32F4 ecosystem:

- **GPIO and LED Control**: Basic digital output and pin configuration, which forms the foundation of any embedded project.
- **ADC Regular Channels**: Implementation of Analog-to-Digital conversion using regular channels, essential for reading sensors and processing analog signals.
- **EXTI (External Interrupts)**: Handling hardware interrupts from external pins, allowing the MCU to respond to real-world events in real-time without polling.
- **SysTick Timer**: Utilizing the standard ARM Cortex-M system tick timer for precise delays and timebase generation.
- **Button Debouncing**: A dedicated module for processing contact bounce in physical buttons, a critical practical skill for creating reliable user interfaces.

## Technical Approach

By using CMSIS, the project ensures that the code is efficient and portable across different Cortex-M processors. The lessons emphasize reading and interpreting hardware datasheets, which are conveniently included in the repository. This approach encourages developers to understand the bit-level configuration of registers such as RCC (Reset and Clock Control), GPIOx_MODER, and ADC_CR, rather than relying on pre-written initialization functions.

## Getting Started

Each folder contains the source code necessary to implement the specific lesson. To use these examples, developers typically need an STM32F4 development board (such as the Discovery or Nucleo series) and a compatible toolchain like Keil MDK, IAR, or an open-source GCC-based environment. Because the code is written at the CMSIS level, it provides a clear view of the initialization sequences required for each peripheral, making it a valuable reference for both beginners and experienced developers debugging more complex systems.
