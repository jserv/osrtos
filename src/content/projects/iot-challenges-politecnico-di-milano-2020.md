## Overview

The IoT-challenges repository is a curated collection of solutions developed for the Internet of Things course at Politecnico di Milano during the 2020 academic year. This repository documents the practical implementation of IoT concepts, ranging from basic connectivity tasks to a more complex final project, reflecting the academic curriculum's focus on building robust, connected embedded systems.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several distinct modules, each representing a specific milestone in the IoT course:

- **Challenge 1 through 5**: These directories contain the incremental steps of the coursework. In a typical IoT academic setting, these challenges often cover fundamental topics such as sensor data acquisition, low-power wireless communication, protocol implementation (such as MQTT or CoAP), and power management strategies for constrained devices.
- **Final Project**: This directory contains the capstone implementation for the course, which usually involves integrating multiple IoT layers—from the physical sensing hardware and local networking to data processing and potentially cloud-side interaction.

## Technical Context

Projects within this repository are designed to address the unique constraints of the Internet of Things, such as limited energy budgets, restricted memory, and the need for reliable communication over lossy wireless networks. While the specific hardware platform is not explicitly detailed in the root documentation, such courses typically utilize microcontrollers like the ESP32, STM32, or specialized IoT hardware like the TelosB or Zolertia nodes.

The solutions provide a practical look at how students at one of Europe's leading technical universities approach the design and development of IoT systems. It serves as a reference for those interested in the architectural patterns and protocol stacks commonly taught in modern embedded systems and IoT engineering programs.
