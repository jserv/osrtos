## Overview

Anemoia-ESP32 is a specialized rewrite and port of the Anemoia Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator, specifically optimized to run on the ESP32 microcontroller. Written in C++, the project focuses on achieving native NTSC speeds (~60.098 FPS) while maintaining full audio emulation. It transforms the ESP32 into a portable retro gaming console capable of running a significant portion of the classic NES library.

## Performance and Compatibility

The emulator is heavily optimized for the Xtensa architecture. By utilizing custom build flags and specific compiler optimizations (such as `-Ofast`, `-flto`, and `-funroll-loops`), it maintains a steady 60 FPS for most popular titles. The project currently supports six major memory mappers:

- **Mapper 0 (NROM)**: Super Mario Bros., Donkey Kong
- **Mapper 1 (MMC1)**: The Legend of Zelda, Mega Man 2, Metroid
- **Mapper 2 (UxROM)**: Contra, Castlevania
- **Mapper 3 (CNROM)**
- **Mapper 4 (MMC3)**: Kirby’s Adventure
- **Mapper 69 (FME-7)**

These mappers account for roughly 79% of the total NES game catalog. While most games run at full speed, titles with complex bank-switching logic, like Kirby’s Adventure, may see slight performance variations.

## Technical Implementation

Anemoia-ESP32 makes efficient use of the ESP32's dual-core architecture and peripheral set. It utilizes **FreeRTOS** primitives to manage concurrent operations, specifically offloading the Audio Processing Unit (APU) to a separate task pinned to Core 0. This ensures that audio generation does not bottleneck the main CPU and PPU (Picture Processing Unit) emulation running on Core 1.

### Audio and Video
Audio is handled via the ESP32's internal DAC using the I2S driver, providing clear sound at a 44.1kHz sample rate. For video, the project integrates the **TFT_eSPI** library, supporting common displays like the ST7789 and ILI9341. It utilizes DMA (Direct Memory Access) for SPI communication to minimize CPU overhead during frame buffer transfers.

### Input Methods
The emulator is flexible regarding hardware interfaces, supporting three distinct input methods:
- Standard GPIO tactile push buttons
- Original NES controllers (via shift register protocol)
- SNES controllers

## Hardware Configuration

The system is designed to work with a standard ESP32 development board connected to a 320x240 TFT display and a MicroSD card module. The MicroSD card stores the `.nes` ROM files, which are loaded into memory via the `SdFat` or standard `SD` library. 

```cpp
void apuTask(void* param) 
{
    Apu2A03* apu = (Apu2A03*)param;
    while (true)
    {
        apu->clock();
    }
}

IRAM_ATTR void emulate()
{
    Bus nes;
    nes.insertCartridge(cart);
    nes.connectScreen(&screen);
    nes.reset();

    // Create a dedicated task for the APU on Core 0
    xTaskCreatePinnedToCore(apuTask, "APU Task", 1024, &nes.cpu.apu, 1, &apu_task_handle, 0);

    while (true) 
    {
        nes.controller = controllerRead();
        nes.clock(); // Generate one frame
        // Frame limiting logic to maintain 60 FPS
    }
}
```

## Getting Started

To build the project, users need the Arduino IDE with the ESP32 board support package (specifically version 3.2.1 for optimal performance). The setup requires a custom `platform.txt` file provided in the repository to enable high-level compiler optimizations that are not active by default in the standard Arduino environment. Additionally, the `TFT_eSPI` library must be configured with a specific header file (`Anemoia-ST7789.h`) to match the project's pinout and display requirements.
