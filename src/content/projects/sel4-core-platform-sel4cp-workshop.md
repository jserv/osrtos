## Overview

The seL4 Core Platform (seL4cp) Workshop repository provides a practical implementation of the popular web-based game "Wordle," built specifically for the seL4 microkernel ecosystem. Originally developed as part of a workshop for the seL4 Summit 2022, this project serves as an introductory guide for developers looking to interact with the seL4 Core Platform, a framework designed to simplify the development of systems on the world's most secure microkernel.

## Technical Architecture

The project is structured as a multi-component system, leveraging the isolation and communication primitives provided by seL4. Instead of a monolithic application, the game is split into distinct functional units:

- **Wordle Server**: Manages the game logic, mystery word selection, and attempt evaluation.
- **Serial Server**: Handles low-level I/O communication, interfacing with the hardware serial port.
- **Client**: The user-facing component that processes input and displays the game state.

This architecture demonstrates the core philosophy of seL4: decomposing a system into small, isolated components that communicate via well-defined interfaces. The use of the seL4 Core Platform framework abstracts much of the underlying microkernel complexity, such as capability management and low-level system calls, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

## Hardware and Simulation

The workshop is designed to run on ARM-based targets. It includes support for:
- **QEMU ARM Virt**: A virtualized environment using `qemu-system-aarch64` with a Cortex-A53 CPU, providing an accessible way to test the system without physical hardware.
- **Raspberry Pi 3B**: The repository contains specific configurations and SDK components for deploying the solution to physical RPi3B hardware.

## Gameplay and Features

The implementation is a faithful C-language recreation of the Wordle mechanics. Users interact with the game via a serial terminal. The system provides visual feedback using standard terminal colors to indicate the accuracy of guesses:
- **Green**: The letter exists and is in the correct position.
- **Yellow**: The letter exists but is in the incorrect position.
- **White**: The letter does not exist in the mystery word.

## Development Environment

The project utilizes a dual build system approach. A `Makefile` provides high-level commands for building and running different parts of the workshop (Part 1 through Part 3), while `CMakeLists.txt` defines the underlying build structure and library dependencies. The repository includes a bundled SDK and workshop materials, ensuring that the environment is reproducible for learners.

To verify the environment, the project includes a 'check' target that boots a simple "hello, world" image in QEMU, confirming that the seL4cp bootstrap process and system invocations are functioning correctly before the user proceeds to the game implementation.
