## Overview

The Geek Magic Firmware project provides a sophisticated, open-source alternative for the popular ESP8266-based "Geek Magic" smart clocks. These devices, often found as affordable desktop accessories, typically come with limited factory software. This custom firmware unlocks the hardware's potential, transforming it into a versatile desktop tool with features ranging from time synchronization to productivity timers.

## Key Features & Capabilities

At its heart, the firmware serves as a highly accurate clock, leveraging Network Time Protocol (NTP) to maintain synchronization with public time servers. Beyond simple timekeeping, the project integrates several features designed for the modern desktop environment:

- **Pomodoro Timer**: Includes a functional Pomodoro counter with standard intervals (25, 5, 45, and 15 minutes) to assist with productivity.
- **Smart WiFi Configuration**: Upon first boot or connection failure, the device generates a QR code on its TFT display. Users can scan this to connect to the device's access point, where a captive portal automatically directs them to a configuration page.
- **Web Dashboard**: A local web server runs on the ESP8266, allowing users to manage preferences and settings through a browser-based interface on their internal network.
- **On-Device Menu**: A robust internal menu system allows for configuration and mode switching directly on the device without needing the web portal.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built using the **Arduino framework** within the **PlatformIO** ecosystem, targeting the **ESP8266** microcontroller. It makes extensive use of the `TFT_eSPI` library for high-performance display rendering and `LittleFS` for managing on-device storage, which holds UI assets, images, and configuration files.

The firmware is optimized for hardware clones featuring the CH340C UART-to-USB converter, which allows for direct flashing via USB without external programmers. 

## Hardware Customization

A unique aspect of this project is the documented hardware modification. To improve interactivity, the author provides instructions for adding a physical push button to the device. This involves:
1. Opening the device and jumping specific pins on the ESP8266.
2. Installing a button on the rear of the case.
3. Wiring the button to GND and the designated GPIO.

This modification enables a rich set of user commands, including single clicks, double clicks, and long presses, which are used to navigate the menu system and control the Pomodoro timer.

## Desktop Integration

Beyond the standalone firmware, the repository includes a Linux-based companion server located in the `linux server` directory. This component can monitor system notifications via DBus and forward them to the ESP8266 device over WebSockets. This integration allows the clock to function as a secondary notification display for a Linux desktop, showing alerts and messages in real-time while the user is working.

## Getting Started

Building the project requires the PlatformIO IDE. Users must configure their `platformio.ini` with the correct upload port and follow a specific sequence to flash both the firmware and the filesystem data:

```bash
# Compile and upload the firmware
pio run --target upload

# Upload the LittleFS image (containing UI assets)
pio run --target uploadfs
```

The project also requires a specific `User_Setup.h` configuration for the `TFT_eSPI` library to correctly drive the device's display, which is provided within the source tree.
