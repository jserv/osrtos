## Overview

The MicroPython TM1637 library provides a robust interface for controlling quad 7-segment LED display modules. These modules, commonly used in clocks, timers, and simple numeric readouts, rely on the TM1637 driver chip. This library abstracts the low-level bit-banging required to communicate with the driver, offering a high-level Pythonic API for developers working with MicroPython-compatible hardware.

## Key Features

The library is designed to be versatile, supporting a wide range of display tasks beyond simple digit output. Key capabilities include:

- **Brightness Control**: Adjust the display intensity across 8 levels (0-7).
- **Flexible Data Entry**: Display integers, hexadecimal values, and formatted strings.
- **Specialized Formatters**: Built-in methods for displaying temperatures (with degree symbols) and time (using the colon segment).
- **Text Effects**: Support for scrolling strings across the display, which is particularly useful for 4-digit modules showing longer messages.
- **Custom Segment Control**: Direct access to individual segments for creating custom characters or symbols.

## Hardware Compatibility

Because the library uses bit-banged GPIO for the Clock (CLK) and Data I/O (DIO) lines, it is compatible with virtually any MicroPython-supported board. The documentation provides tested connection examples for several popular platforms:

- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: Using IO27 (CLK) and IO26 (DIO).
- **TinyPICO (ESP32)**: Using IO18 (CLK) and IO23 (DIO).
- **WeMos D1 Mini (ESP8266)**: Using D1 (CLK) and D2 (DIO).

The library has been verified with various hardware modules, including the Seeed Studio Grove 4-Digit Display, RobotDyn 4-digit and 6-digit tubes, and generic TM1637 modules found on common electronics marketplaces.

## Technical Implementation

The driver handles the specific timing requirements of the TM1637 protocol, including start/stop signals and byte-level transmission with acknowledgment cycles. It includes a comprehensive segment map for the standard 7-segment font, covering numbers 0-9 and a basic alphabet (A-Z, though limited by the physical segments available).

For modules that feature a decimal point after every digit instead of a central colon, the library provides a specialized `TM1637Decimal` class. This subclass overrides the string encoding logic to correctly handle the 8th bit (MSB) of each segment, which typically controls the decimal point on those specific hardware variants.

## Getting Started

Basic initialization requires defining the pins used for the clock and data lines. Once initialized, displaying data is straightforward:

```python
import tm1637
from machine import Pin

# Initialize the display
tm = tm1637.TM1637(clk=Pin(5), dio=Pin(4))

# Show a simple string
tm.show('help')

# Display a number
tm.number(-123)

# Display temperature
tm.temperature(24)

# Show hex values
tm.hex(0xbeef)
```

For more advanced use cases, such as creating custom animations or handling specific segment layouts, the `write()` method allows passing raw byte arrays directly to the driver.
