Xenomai 3 brings hard real-time capabilities to the Linux kernel, and this project specifically targets the Raspberry Pi 4. By using the I-pipe (Interrupt Pipeline) patch, it allows the system to handle time-critical tasks with deterministic latency while still running a standard Linux environment for non-real-time operations.

The repository provides a complete package for developers looking to implement real-time control systems on the RPi4. This includes a pre-built 4.19.y kernel patched with I-pipe, along with the necessary Xenomai user-space libraries and tools.

## Deployment and Configuration

Setting up a real-time kernel on the Raspberry Pi 4 involves more than just swapping the kernel image. This project includes a `deploy.sh` script to automate the process, but also highlights several critical manual configurations required for stability and performance.

One of the first steps after deployment is fixing the Linux headers. This ensures that developers can build native modules directly on the Raspberry Pi in the future. While the process may generate some warnings during `modules_prepare`, it is a necessary step for a functional development environment.

## Optimizing for Real-Time Performance

To achieve the best latency results, several system-level tweaks are required:

- **DWC OTG Tweaks**: Disabling FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request) features in the USB controller is necessary to prevent conflicts with the I-pipe kernel. This is handled by adding specific flags to the `cmdline.txt` file.
- **CPU Affinity**: To ensure deterministic performance, the project recommends isolating specific CPU cores for Xenomai tasks using the `isolcpus` and `xenomai.supported_cpus` parameters. This prevents the standard Linux scheduler from interfering with real-time tasks on designated cores.

## Addressing Raspberry Pi 4 Hardware Quirks

One of the unique aspects of this project is how it addresses specific RPi4 hardware limitations. For instance, on the 4GB RAM version of the Pi, the PCIe DMA controller can only access the first 3GB of RAM. This can cause significant issues for USB devices when using an I-pipe kernel, especially when GPU memory is set high. The project suggests a workaround by limiting the usable memory to 3GB via the `total_mem` setting in `config.txt`.

Additionally, because the OpenGL driver (VC4) is currently incompatible with Xenomai on this platform, the project advises disabling it to maintain system stability. This is a common trade-off in real-time embedded systems where stability and low latency are prioritized over graphical acceleration.

## Getting Started

The repository is structured to be a "pull down and deploy" solution. Users can clone the repository, navigate to the prebuilt directory, and run the deployment script. Once the system reboots and the manual configuration steps are completed, the Raspberry Pi 4 will be running a dual-kernel configuration where the Xenomai co-kernel manages real-time tasks with high priority, while the Linux kernel handles general-purpose computing.
