## Overview

The lwIP (lightweight IP) stack is a widely used TCP/IP implementation designed specifically for embedded systems. This repository provides a contribution port that allows the lwIP stack to run on a standard Ubuntu Linux environment. By leveraging the Linux TAP interface, developers can simulate an embedded network device directly on their host machine, facilitating rapid prototyping and debugging of network-enabled firmware without requiring physical hardware.

## Working Principle

The project functions by creating a virtual `tap1` interface on the host Ubuntu system. This interface acts as a bridge, linking the host's networking environment to the lwIP stack running as a user-space application. This setup allows the user to run network applications on the same machine but with distinct IP addresses, effectively simulating a multi-node network on a single workstation.

When the application starts, it initializes the lwIP stack and binds it to the virtual interface. This allows standard Linux networking tools to interact with the lwIP-managed stack as if it were a separate physical device on the network.

## Technical Configuration

To align the simulated stack with a specific network environment, users can modify the network parameters directly within the source code. The primary configuration occurs in `main.c`, where the Gateway, IP Address, and Subnet Mask are defined using the `IP4_ADDR` macro:

```c
IP4_ADDR(&gw, 192,168,1,1);
IP4_ADDR(&ipaddr, 192,168,1,20);
IP4_ADDR(&netmask, 255,255,255,0);
```

## Build and Execution

The project uses a standard Makefile-based build system. The core logic is located within the `contrib/ports/unix/minimal` directory. Building the project is as simple as running `make`, which produces an executable named `echop`. Because the application needs to create and manage TAP interfaces, it requires root privileges to run successfully.

Upon execution, the system provides real-time feedback via stdout, confirming the initialization of the TCP/IP stack, SNMP private MIB detection, and the startup of internal applications.

## Testing and Communication

The repository includes a built-in echo server to verify connectivity. Once the `tap1` interface is active, users can test communication using standard utilities like `nc` (netcat):

- **TCP Testing**: By connecting to the configured IP on port 45678, users can send strings and receive them back via the echo server.
- **UDP Testing**: Similarly, UDP communication can be verified on port 7.

This environment is particularly useful for developers working on IoT protocols, custom application-layer services, or anyone needing to validate lwIP-based logic in a controlled, high-visibility environment before deploying to target microcontrollers.
