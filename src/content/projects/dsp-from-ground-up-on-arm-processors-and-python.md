## Overview

This repository serves as a practical companion to the "DSP From Ground Up" course series, providing a deep dive into Digital Signal Processing (DSP) for both ARM-based embedded systems and Python environments. The project bridges the gap between theoretical signal processing mathematics and real-world implementation on hardware, specifically targeting ARM Cortex-M processors using the CMSIS-DSP library.

## Digital Signal Processing on ARM

The core of the project focuses on high-performance DSP implementation on ARM microcontrollers. By leveraging the CMSIS-DSP (Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard) library, the examples demonstrate how to utilize hardware-specific optimizations for common mathematical operations. Key areas covered include:

- **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**: Efficient frequency analysis on embedded hardware.
- **Filter Design**: Implementation of Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters.
- **Convolution and Correlation**: Fundamental operations for signal analysis and system characterization.
- **Linear Systems**: Practical applications of linear system theory in firmware.

## Practical DSP in Python

In addition to embedded C code, the repository contains over 70 Python examples. This dual-language approach allows developers to prototype algorithms in a high-level environment before porting them to resource-constrained ARM hardware. The Python section covers windowing filters, convolution, and complex signal analysis, providing a robust foundation for understanding the underlying math before tackling the complexities of embedded memory management and real-time constraints.

## Advanced Audio and ML Integration

Beyond standard DSP, the repository explores specialized domains including:

- **Embedded Audio Programming**: Techniques for processing real-time audio streams on microcontrollers.
- **Audio Coding**: Fundamentals of how audio data is compressed and represented.
- **Machine Learning for Audio**: Introductory concepts for applying ML models to audio signals in an embedded context.
- **Multirate DSP**: Handling systems with multiple sampling rates, essential for modern audio interfaces.

## Technical Implementation

The project is organized into modular directories, each focusing on a specific aspect of signal processing. The `EmbeddedAudioProgramming` and `AdvancedDSP` folders contain the bulk of the ARM-specific logic, while the `DSPFromGroundUp` directory provides the foundational Python scripts. This structure makes it an excellent resource for engineers looking to move from software-based signal analysis to bare-metal firmware development.
