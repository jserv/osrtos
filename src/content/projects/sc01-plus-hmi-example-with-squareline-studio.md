The SC01 Plus HMI Example repository is a practical guide for developers looking to leverage the power of the SC01 Plus display module. This hardware, often featuring the ESP32-S3 SoC, is a popular choice for embedded systems that require a compact yet capable touch interface. By combining the visual design capabilities of SquareLine Studio with the robust LVGL graphics library, this project demonstrates a modern workflow for embedded UI development.

### Visual Design with SquareLine Studio
At the heart of the project is the integration between design and code. SquareLine Studio allows for the creation of complex interfaces through a drag-and-drop environment, but it requires specific board configurations to correctly target hardware. This repository provides those essential configuration files, ensuring that the touch controller and display driver are correctly mapped from the start. By using the provided custom board config, developers can ensure that their visual designs translate accurately to the 3.5-inch 320x480 screen.

### Technical Foundation: LVGL v8.3.3
The technical foundation is built on LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) version 8.3.3. The included `lv_conf.h` file is a crucial reference, showing how to tune the library for the SC01 Plus. Key configurations include:

- **Memory Optimization**: The project allocates 48KB of RAM for LVGL's internal heap, balancing performance with the ESP32-S3's available resources.
- **Color Depth**: It uses a 16-bit color depth (RGB565), which is the standard for these types of SPI/Parallel displays, providing a good balance between visual quality and memory usage.
- **Tick Management**: The library is configured to use the Arduino `millis()` function as its time base, which is essential for handling animations, input debouncing, and screen transitions.

### The Kingfisher Example
The 'Kingfisher' example serves as a concrete implementation, showing how the exported UI code is initialized and updated within a standard Arduino sketch. It demonstrates the typical lifecycle of an LVGL application: initializing the display driver, setting up the touch input device, and calling the timer handler in the main loop. This example is particularly useful for understanding how to link the UI generated by SquareLine Studio with the underlying application logic.

### Hardware Compatibility
While specifically targeting the SC01 Plus, the principles and configurations shown here are applicable to a wide range of ESP32-S3 based display modules. The project highlights the importance of matching the software configuration to the hardware's physical properties, such as DPI (set to 130 in this project) and color swapping requirements.

Whether you are building an IoT gateway, a smart home controller, or an industrial interface, this example provides the scaffolding needed to move from a blank screen to a functional, interactive HMI. It eliminates the guesswork often associated with setting up new display hardware and allows developers to focus on creating a great user experience.
