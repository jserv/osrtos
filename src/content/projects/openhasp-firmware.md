openHASP is a powerful, open-source firmware designed to transform commodity touchscreen displays into versatile home automation controllers. Originally inspired by the HASwitchPlate project, openHASP represents a significant evolution by removing the requirement for proprietary Nextion hardware. Instead, it leverages the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL) to drive a wide array of affordable LCD and OLED displays directly from the MCU.

## Core Capabilities and Architecture

The project is built to run on high-performance microcontrollers like the ESP32 and STM32F4, taking advantage of their hardware capabilities to deliver a smooth, responsive user interface. By using MQTT as its primary communication protocol, openHASP integrates seamlessly with popular home automation platforms such as Home Assistant, OpenHAB, and Node-RED. 

One of the standout features of openHASP is its configuration-driven approach. Users can define their UI layout using `pages.jsonl` files, which utilize a simple JSON Lines format to describe buttons, sliders, labels, and other widgets. This allows for rapid prototyping and easy updates without needing to recompile the firmware for every UI change.

## Hardware and Display Support

openHASP supports a vast ecosystem of hardware, including:
- **Microcontrollers**: ESP32, ESP32-S3, ESP32-C3, and STM32F4xx series.
- **Display Drivers**: Integration with popular drivers like TFT_eSPI, LovyanGFX, and Arduino_GFX.
- **Touch Controllers**: Support for various capacitive and resistive touch chips, including Goodix, FT6336, TSC2007, and GSL1680.
- **Ready-to-use Boards**: Pre-configured setups for devices like the Lanbon L8, M5Stack Core2, Lilygo TTGO, and various Sunton or Elecrow displays.

## Feature-Rich User Interface

Beyond simple buttons, openHASP provides a rich set of UI components and features:
- **Advanced Objects**: Support for QR codes, canvases, drop-down lists, tab views, and animated spinners.
- **Theming and Customization**: A built-in HASP theme that adapts to different screen sizes, with support for custom TrueType fonts and Material Design icons.
- **Dynamic Content**: The ability to update object properties (like text, color, or value) in real-time via MQTT commands.
- **Media Support**: Displaying images (PNG, BMP, GIF) from local storage or via URL, provided the hardware has sufficient PSram.

## Connectivity and Management

The firmware includes a robust web interface for device management. From the browser, users can configure Wi-Fi and MQTT settings, manage GPIO pins, and use a built-in file editor to modify configuration scripts or UI definitions. It also supports over-the-air (OTA) updates, Telnet for remote logging, and even a simple FTP server for easy file transfers to the device's internal storage (SPIFFS or LittleFS).

For Home Assistant users, openHASP offers a custom component that facilitates automatic discovery, making it trivial to link the physical touchscreen to virtual entities in the automation dashboard. Whether you are building a simple light switch or a complex multi-page media controller, openHASP provides the tools to create a professional-grade interface on low-cost embedded hardware.
