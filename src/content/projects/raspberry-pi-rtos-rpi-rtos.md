## Overview

Raspberry Pi RTOS (RPI RTOS) is a specialized build system designed to simplify the creation of a real-time operating system environment for the Raspberry Pi. By leveraging Buildroot and the Xenomai real-time framework, this project allows developers to generate custom Linux images that incorporate the hard real-time capabilities required for industrial control, robotics, and low-latency signal processing.

The project focuses on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, providing pre-configured build targets that integrate the necessary kernel patches and configuration files to get a real-time system running quickly.

## Technical Architecture

The core of this project is the integration of **Xenomai 3.1** with the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel. Xenomai uses a dual-kernel architecture (often referred to as the I-pipe or Adeos patch) that allows a real-time kernel to run side-by-side with the standard Linux kernel. The real-time kernel handles high-priority tasks with deterministic latency, while the Linux kernel manages non-critical system services, networking, and file systems.

### Supported Configurations

The repository currently supports the following hardware and software combinations:

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B
- **Architectures**: ARM (32-bit) and ARM64 (64-bit)
- **Linux Kernel**: Version 4.19.127
- **Xenomai Version**: 3.1
- **Patches**: Uses unofficial I-pipe core patches (4.19.128-arm-9 and 4.19.144-arm64-7)

## Build System and Usage

The project utilizes a `Makefile` wrapper around Buildroot to manage the complex process of downloading source code, applying patches, and cross-compiling the toolchain and kernel. 

To build a real-time image, users select a target configuration from the `buildroot-external/configs` directory. For example, to build for a 64-bit Raspberry Pi 3, the command is:

```bash
make rpi3_64_4.19
```

This process automates several critical steps:
1. Downloading the specific Buildroot version (2022.02.2).
2. Applying custom patches to the Buildroot environment.
3. Fetching the Raspberry Pi Linux kernel source.
4. Applying the Xenomai I-pipe patches to the kernel.
5. Compiling the entire system into a bootable `sdcard.img`.

## Getting Started

Once the build is complete, the resulting image can be written directly to an SD card using standard tools like `dd`:

```bash
sudo dd if=./build-rpi3_64_4.19/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdx
```

After booting the Raspberry Pi, developers can begin "hacking" the system, utilizing Xenomai's APIs to develop real-time applications. The project structure is designed to be extensible, allowing users to modify the Buildroot configuration via `menuconfig` or add their own packages through the `buildroot-external` tree.

## References and Resources

This project serves as a bridge between several major open-source efforts. It relies heavily on the official [Xenomai project](https://xenomai.org/) for real-time capabilities and the [Raspberry Pi Linux kernel](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux) for hardware support. By combining these with Buildroot, it provides a reproducible and lightweight way to deploy real-time Linux on one of the world's most popular single-board computers.
