## Overview

This repository serves as a personal workspace for experiments with the Apache NuttX Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). NuttX is a professional-grade, POSIX-compliant RTOS designed for microcontrollers and embedded systems, emphasizing standards compliance and a small footprint. This project focuses on practical implementations, hardware porting, and driver development within the NuttX ecosystem.

By maintaining custom configurations and driver code, the project provides a foundation for testing specific hardware features and optimizing the OS for various embedded targets. It follows the standard NuttX structure, making it easier to integrate these experiments back into the main source tree or use them as a reference for similar hardware ports.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to align with the modular architecture of NuttX, featuring several critical directories:

- **Configs**: This directory contains board-specific configuration files. These are essential for defining the hardware abstraction layer (HAL), memory maps, and enabled features for specific microcontroller boards. These configurations allow the user to toggle kernel features and middleware through the standard Kconfig system.
- **Drivers**: Includes custom device driver implementations. These drivers allow the RTOS to interact with peripherals such as sensors, displays, or communication interfaces that might not be present in the mainline NuttX distribution.
- **Include**: Houses header files required for the custom drivers and system configurations, ensuring proper API definitions and interoperability across the project.

## Technical Implementation

NuttX is unique among RTOSs for its strict adherence to POSIX and ANSI standards. This repository leverages those standards to implement portable embedded code. The experiments typically involve:

- **Board Porting**: Setting up the necessary logic to boot NuttX on specific hardware platforms, including clock initialization and memory controller setup.
- **Peripheral Integration**: Developing and testing character or block drivers to expose hardware functionality to user-space applications via standard Unix-like file operations such as `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, and `ioctl()`.
- **System Tuning**: Adjusting kernel parameters to balance performance and resource usage, which is critical for resource-constrained 8-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers.

## About NuttX

NuttX provides a development environment similar to Linux but scaled down for deeply embedded systems. It supports a wide range of architectures including ARM (Cortex-M, Cortex-A), RISC-V, and ESP32. Its modular design allows developers to include only the necessary components, making it an ideal choice for IoT devices, industrial controllers, and robotics where real-time performance and reliability are paramount.
