## Overview

This project serves as an experimental foundation for running Mongoose OS on the STM32F446RE microcontroller, specifically targeting the NUCLEO-F446RE development board. While Mongoose OS provides robust support for various platforms, this repository addresses specific gaps and bugs encountered when targeting the STM32F4 family, offering a path for developers to build and flash firmware using the `mos` toolchain.

The project is structured as an application skeleton that integrates custom board definitions and patched build environments to overcome limitations in the standard Mongoose OS distribution for this specific hardware.

## Technical Implementation and Challenges

Bringing Mongoose OS to the STM32F446RE required several significant modifications to the standard workflow. The project highlights the necessity of using a custom Docker build image to resolve bugs within the STM32 Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) and Low-Layer (LL) libraries that typically prevent successful builds for the STM32F4 platform.

Key technical components include:
- **Custom Board Definitions**: Integration of a modified boards library that includes specific entries for the NUCLEO-F446RE.
- **Patched Core**: Modifications to the Mongoose OS core repository to ensure compatibility with the STM32F4 architecture.
- **Binary Libraries**: The project utilizes pre-compiled static binary libraries for Mongoose and mbedTLS, specifically adapted for the STM32F446RE, as these are not always available in the standard release pages for this platform.

## Build and Deployment Workflow

The project utilizes the standard `mos` build tool but with a highly specific configuration. The build process is designed to run locally using a custom Docker image (`meticulouscraftman/stm32-build:r19`) which contains the necessary patches for the STM32 toolchain. 

For flashing the firmware, the project deviates from the standard `mos flash` command due to detection issues with certain ST-Link versions on Linux. Instead, it integrates with the `stlink-tools` suite, specifically utilizing `st-flash` to deploy the generated `fw.zip` to the target hardware.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the application source code.
- **mos.yml**: The primary configuration file defining dependencies, build variables, and manifest versions.
- **binary_libs**: A directory for storing the platform-specific static libraries required for the build.
- **boards**: Submodule or directory containing the extended board definitions for the NUCLEO-F446RE.

This repository is a valuable resource for developers looking to port Mongoose OS to unsupported STM32 variants or those needing a reference for complex local build configurations involving custom Docker images and binary library management.
