## Overview

PPP Device is a software package designed for the RT-Thread operating system that implements Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) functionality using the lwIP protocol stack. Its primary purpose is to enable cellular modules (2G/3G/4G) to handle network data transmission through PPP rather than relying on traditional AT commands for data flow. This abstraction allows developers to treat cellular modems as standard network interfaces within the RT-Thread ecosystem.

By utilizing PPP, the package provides a reliable data link with error detection and seamless compatibility with higher-level application protocols such as HTTP, MQTT, and TLS. It integrates directly with RT-Thread's Socket Abstraction Layer (SAL), allowing developers to use standard BSD Socket APIs for network programming regardless of the underlying cellular hardware.

## Key Features

- **Broad Hardware Support**: The package includes specific drivers and porting logic for several popular cellular modules, including Luat Air720, Quectel EC20, China Mobile M6312, SIMCOM SIM800, and ML305.
- **Simplified Initialization**: It features a CHAT-based initialization system, which simplifies the process of porting to new modules by automating the modem interaction sequence.
- **Network Stack Integration**: Once a PPP connection is established, the package registers a `netdev` (network interface device). This makes the cellular connection appear as a standard interface in tools like `ifconfig` and `ping`.
- **Link Monitoring**: Includes built-in link status detection to monitor the health of the connection and handle timeouts or disconnections gracefully.

## Technical Architecture

The PPP Device package sits between the lwIP protocol stack and the hardware-specific UART interface. The architecture follows a clear path: 

1.  **Application Layer**: Uses BSD Socket APIs.
2.  **SAL (Socket Abstraction Layer)**: Provides a unified interface for different network stacks.
3.  **netdev**: The RT-Thread network device component.
4.  **ppp_device**: This package, implementing the lwIP PPP porting.
5.  **Hardware**: The cellular modem connected via UART.

## Getting Started

The package is designed to be easily integrated via the RT-Thread package manager. Once configured through `menuconfig`, the PPP service can be started automatically or manually. A typical startup sequence involves finding the device and attaching it to the PPP framework:

```c
int ppp_sample_start(void)
{
    rt_device_t device = RT_NULL;
    device = rt_device_find(PPP_DEVICE_NAME);
    if(device == RT_NULL)
    {
        return -RT_ERROR;
    }
    if(ppp_device_attach((struct ppp_device *)device, PPP_CLIENT_NAME, RT_NULL) != RT_EOK)
    {
        return -RT_ERROR;
    }
    return RT_EOK;
}
```

Once the `ppp_device_attach` function is called, the system handles the modem dialing process and enters PPP mode. Users can verify the connection status using the FinSH command line by typing `ifconfig`, which will display the assigned IP address, gateway, and DNS servers provided by the cellular carrier.

## Implementation Considerations

When deploying PPP Device, developers should be aware of several system requirements. The lwIP TCP thread stack size (`RT_LWIP_TCPTHREAD_STACKSIZE`) should be configured to at least 2048 bytes to ensure stability during network operations. Additionally, because cellular modules often have significant power-on delays, it is important to account for modem boot time before attempting to initiate the PPP sequence. The package also recommends avoiding DMA TX on the UART interface in certain configurations to maintain data integrity during the PPP negotiation phase.
