## Overview

The LVGL Game Boy Advance (GBA) Emulator is a specialized port of the vba-next emulator kernel designed to work seamlessly with the Light and Versatile Graphics Library (LVGL). By leveraging LVGL's powerful GUI capabilities, this project provides a portable, high-performance emulation environment that can run on a variety of platforms, ranging from desktop PCs to embedded Linux devices like the Raspberry Pi.

One of the standout features of this implementation is its decoupling from the underlying operating system. The emulator kernel relies primarily on LVGL's memory allocation and file access interfaces, making it significantly easier to port to different hardware environments where LVGL is already supported.

## Key Features

- **Optimized Rendering**: The emulator supports using the GBA framebuffer directly as an `lv_canvas` buffer. This allows for zero-copy overhead, which is critical for maintaining high frame rates on resource-constrained embedded hardware.
- **Low Memory Footprint**: The project is optimized for memory usage, requiring approximately 800KB of RAM plus the size of the ROM being loaded.
- **Integrated Game Launcher**: Includes a built-in ROM selection menu, allowing users to browse and launch games directly from the GUI.
- **Audio and Input Support**: Features audio output capabilities, frame rate control, and support for multiple input devices, including virtual on-screen keypads.
- **Save State Support**: Includes automatic loading and saving of game progress.

## Technical Architecture

The project is built upon the `vba-next` emulator core, which is a fast and portable GBA emulator. The integration layer handles the translation between the emulator's output and LVGL's drawing primitives. 

For hardware interaction, the project provides specific ports:
- **PC (Linux/Unix)**: Uses SDL2 for display and input handling, providing a robust environment for testing and development.
- **Raspberry Pi**: Specifically targets the GamePi20 and similar setups, including an installation script for automatic startup on boot. It utilizes NEON assembly optimizations on supported ARM processors to enhance performance.

## Getting Started

The project uses CMake as its build system. For PC users, building is as simple as creating a build directory and running the standard CMake workflow. The emulator can be launched from the command line with options to specify the ROM file, directory, view mode (simple or virtual keypad), and volume.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
./gba_emu -d ../rom
```

### Controls and Key Mapping

When running on a PC with SDL2, the emulator maps standard GBA buttons to the keyboard (e.g., Z for A, X for B, Backspace for Select, and Tab for Start). A unique feature is the "Exit to Menu" shortcut: long-pressing the `Select` button (or Backspace on a keyboard) for 2 seconds returns the user to the ROM selection menu.

## Embedded Optimization

For developers targeting embedded systems, the `lv_conf.h` file provided in the repository shows a highly tuned LVGL configuration. It enables specific widgets like `lv_canvas`, `lv_button`, and `lv_list` while disabling unnecessary features to keep the binary size small. It also configures the memory pool to 64MB (adjustable) and sets the color depth to 16-bit (RGB565), which matches the native output of the GBA hardware.
