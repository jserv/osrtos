Xenomai on Raspberry Pi provides a specialized environment for developers looking to achieve hard real-time performance on one of the most popular single-board computers. While standard Linux is not deterministic by default, Xenomai introduces a dual-kernel architecture that allows real-time tasks to run with high priority and low latency alongside a standard Linux distribution.

This project specifically focuses on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 (CM4), utilizing the Raspbian Lite 64-bit distribution as a foundation. By following the provided documentation, users can transform their Raspberry Pi into a powerful real-time controller suitable for robotics, industrial automation, and high-speed data acquisition.

## Why Xenomai?

Xenomai is distinct from other real-time solutions like PREEMPT_RT. It uses a dual-kernel approach where a real-time core (Cobalt) runs side-by-side with the standard Linux kernel. The Cobalt core handles real-time interrupts and task scheduling with minimal jitter, ensuring that time-critical operations are never delayed by standard OS activities like disk I/O or network interrupts.

## Target Hardware and OS

The implementation steps and configurations provided in this repository have been verified on specific hardware and software stacks to ensure reliability:

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4
- **Operating System**: Raspbian Lite 64-bit

While the guide is tailored for the CM4, the principles of patching the kernel and configuring the Xenomai user-space libraries are often applicable to other Raspberry Pi models with minor adjustments to the kernel configuration and build parameters.

## Getting Started

The repository serves as a gateway to a detailed step-by-step guide hosted via GitHub Pages. This guide covers the entire lifecycle of setting up a real-time system, including:

- **Environment Setup**: Preparing the cross-compilation toolchain on a host machine.
- **Kernel Patching**: Downloading the appropriate Linux kernel sources and applying the Xenomai I-pipe or Dovetail patches.
- **Configuration**: Tuning the kernel configuration (Kconfig) to optimize for real-time performance and disabling features that introduce latency.
- **Compilation and Installation**: Building the patched kernel and deploying it to the target Raspberry Pi hardware.
- **Validation**: Running latency tests and smoke tests to ensure the real-time core is functioning correctly.

For those looking to dive into real-time programming on ARM-based hardware, this project provides a clear path to bypassing the non-deterministic nature of standard Linux and unlocking the full potential of the Raspberry Pi for time-critical applications.
