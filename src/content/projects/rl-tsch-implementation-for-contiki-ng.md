## Overview

The RL-TSCH implementation is a specialized extension for the Contiki-NG operating system, focusing on enhancing the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) MAC layer using Reinforcement Learning. TSCH is a core component of the IEEE 802.15.4e standard, designed to provide high reliability and low power consumption in industrial IoT environments. This project introduces intelligent scheduling mechanisms that move beyond static or minimal 6TiSCH schedules by leveraging RL to adapt to network conditions.

## Key Features

- **RL-Based Scheduling**: Implements reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize slotframe scheduling, improving throughput and reducing latency in dynamic network environments.
- **Contiki-NG Integration**: Designed as a set of modified files for the Contiki-NG stack, allowing it to leverage existing network services like RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) and the 6lowpan adaptation layer.
- **Cooja Support**: Specifically configured for the Cooja simulator, enabling researchers to validate RL scheduling policies in a controlled, simulated environment before hardware deployment.
- **Configurable TSCH Parameters**: Provides extensive configuration options through `project-conf.h`, including custom hopping sequences, PANID settings, and packet buffer tuning.

## Technical Implementation

The project modifies core components of the Contiki-NG TSCH implementation. By setting the `RL_TSCH_ENABLED` flag, the system bypasses the default 6TiSCH minimal schedule in favor of the RL-driven logic. Key configuration parameters include:

- **Queue Management**: Enhanced packet buffer lengths (`QUEUEBUF_CONF_NUM`) and payload sizes to accommodate the overhead of scheduling records.
- **Hopping Sequences**: Support for various channel hopping patterns, such as `TSCH_HOPPING_SEQUENCE_2_2`, to mitigate interference.
- **Logging and Debugging**: Integrated transmission record printing and queue statistics to monitor the performance of the RL agent in real-time.

## Getting Started

As this project consists of modified files for Contiki-NG, it is intended to be placed within a Contiki-NG source tree. The `Makefile` defines the project as `new-rl-tsch` and targets the `cooja` platform. Users can enable or disable specific features like TSCH security or 6TiSCH minimal scheduling via the `project-conf.h` file. 

To begin simulation, the project includes a `node.c` file which serves as the entry point for network nodes. This file initializes the stack and triggers the RL-based MAC layer. Developers can monitor the system through the Contiki-NG shell, which is included as a module in the build process.
