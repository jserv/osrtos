## Overview

Inspecting filesystem images from embedded devices can often be a cumbersome process, requiring specialized command-line tools or mounting images on a host OS. The littlefs Disk Image Viewer simplifies this workflow by providing a modern, web-based interface to browse [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) disk images directly in your browser. 

By leveraging WebAssembly, the tool brings the actual littlefs implementation into the browser environment, ensuring that the filesystem logic used to read the image is identical to what runs on the target microcontroller. This approach provides a high-fidelity view of the data as the embedded system sees it.

## How It Works

The core of this application is a WebAssembly (Wasm) port of the littlefs library. The project implements an emulated block device that interfaces between the browser's file handling and the Wasm-compiled C code. 

One of the most impressive aspects of the viewer is its memory efficiency. Rather than loading an entire disk image into RAM—which could be problematic for large images—the application only loads the specific parts of the disk image currently requested by the littlefs logic. By default, the application caches up to 1 MiB of data in memory and allocates a mere 64 KiB for the littlefs implementation itself. This allows users to explore almost arbitrarily large disk images without crashing the browser tab or consuming excessive system resources.

## Technical Implementation

The project uses a sophisticated build pipeline to bridge the gap between embedded C code and the web. The `build.sh` script demonstrates the use of `clang` with the `wasm32-unknown-wasi` target to compile the littlefs source files (`lfs*.c`) along with a custom glue layer (`src/glue.c`). 

To handle the asynchronous nature of web file I/O within the synchronous execution model of the littlefs C library, the project utilizes `wasm-opt` with the `--asyncify` flag. This allows the Wasm module to pause and resume execution while waiting for data to be read from the local disk image file. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS and incorporates Heroicons for a clean, intuitive user interface.

## Usage and Compatibility

Using the viewer is straightforward: users provide a disk image file and specify the block size. While many filesystem parameters can be detected automatically, the block size is a critical manual input required for successful mounting. 

**Key considerations for users:**
- **Browser Support:** Requires a modern web browser with WebAssembly support.
- **Filesystem Version:** The tool is designed for the current version of littlefs. Users with images from older versions may need to use `lfs_migrate` to update their filesystem layout before viewing.
- **Read-Only:** The viewer is currently optimized for browsing and inspecting; it mounts the filesystem in a read-only state to ensure the integrity of the source image.

This tool is an invaluable resource for embedded developers working with littlefs, providing a quick and easy way to verify file contents, directory structures, and filesystem health during development and debugging.
