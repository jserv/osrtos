## Overview

The rtt-ccs811 package provides a robust driver for the CCS811 digital gas sensor, specifically tailored for the RT-Thread ecosystem. The CCS811 is a low-power sensor designed for monitoring indoor air quality, capable of detecting a wide range of Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) and providing equivalent CO2 (eCO2) readings. It features an integrated micro-controller unit (MCU) and an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC), communicating with host controllers via a standard I2C interface.

This driver is designed to be flexible, supporting both static and dynamic memory allocation, and is fully thread-safe, making it suitable for complex multi-threaded RTOS environments.

## Key Features

- **Dual Interface Support**: Provides both a custom API for direct control and a standard RT-Thread sensor framework interface (`open`/`read`/`control`/`close`).
- **Memory Management**: Supports both static and dynamic memory allocation to suit different system resource constraints.
- **Thread Safety**: Built-in mechanisms ensure the driver can be safely accessed from multiple threads.
- **Configurable Communication**: Supports I2C address configuration (0x5A or 0x5B) and multiple measurement cycles (250ms, 1s, 10s, 60s).
- **Environmental Compensation**: Includes APIs to set ambient temperature and humidity data, allowing the sensor to provide more accurate gas concentration readings.

## Technical Implementation

The driver is structured into clear directories: `inc` for headers, `src` for the core logic, and `examples` for implementation references. It leverages the RT-Thread `sensor` device framework, allowing the CCS811 to appear as a standard device in the system. This integration allows users to use standard shell commands like `sensor probe` and `sensor read` to interact with the hardware during development.

### Measurement Modes

The CCS811 supports several operating modes, ranging from idle to high-frequency sampling. The driver allows developers to configure these modes easily using the `ccs811_cycle_t` enumeration, balancing power consumption against data resolution.

## Getting Started

To use this package, it must be selected via the RT-Thread package manager (menuconfig):

```
RT-Thread online packages --->
    peripheral libraries and drivers --->
        [*] sensors drivers  --->
            [*] CCS811: Digital Gas Sensor for Monitoring Indoor Air Quality..
```

### Example: Using the Sensor Framework

Registering the sensor within the RT-Thread environment is straightforward. Below is a snippet showing how to initialize the device on a specific I2C bus:

```c
#include "ccs811.h"

#define CCS811_I2C_BUS_NAME "i2c1"

static int rt_hw_ccs811_port(void)
{
    struct rt_sensor_config cfg;
    
    cfg.intf.type = RT_SENSOR_INTF_I2C;
    cfg.intf.dev_name = CCS811_I2C_BUS_NAME;
    rt_hw_ccs811_init("cs8", &cfg);
    
    return RT_EOK;
}
INIT_COMPONENT_EXPORT(rt_hw_ccs811_port);
```

## Important Considerations

When working with the CCS811, developers should be aware of several hardware characteristics documented in the driver's notes:
- **Preheating**: The sensor requires a warm-up period of approximately 15 seconds before providing valid data.
- **Burn-in**: For new sensors, a 48-hour initial run-in period is recommended by the manufacturer.
- **Baseline Calibration**: The sensor automatically calibrates its baseline over time. The driver provides APIs to manually get and set these baseline values, which is recommended for maintaining accuracy across power cycles.
- **Dual Device Registration**: Because the CCS811 provides both TVOC and eCO2 data, the RT-Thread sensor framework will register two distinct devices (e.g., `tvoc_cs8` and `eco2_cs8`).
