## Overview

The IOT_ESP8266_webserver_SPIFFS project serves as a practical guide for developers working with the ESP8266 (NodeMCU) platform. It focuses on two core functionalities essential for modern IoT devices: hosting a web server to provide a control interface and utilizing the Serial Peripheral Interface Flash File System (SPIFFS) for persistent data storage. By combining these features, the project enables the creation of responsive, networked embedded systems that can serve web content and manage state effectively.

## Key Features

- **Web Server Implementation**: Utilizes the `ESP8266WebServer` library to handle HTTP requests and serve responses.
- **JSON API**: Provides a structured way to interact with the hardware, returning pin statuses and error messages in JSON format.
- **GPIO Control**: Enables remote switching of multiple GPIO pins (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, and D8) through simple URL endpoints.
- **SPIFFS Integration**: Leverages the ESP8266's internal flash memory to store files, allowing for more complex web interfaces than those hardcoded into the firmware.
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Supports standard station mode for connecting to existing wireless networks.

## Technical Implementation

The project is built using the Arduino framework for ESP8266. The core logic revolves around mapping HTTP endpoints to specific functions. For instance, the `/on` and `/off` routes are used to toggle the state of digital pins. 

One interesting aspect of the implementation is the manual construction of JSON strings for responses. This approach avoids the overhead of a full JSON library while still providing a machine-readable format for client-side applications or mobile apps to consume. The pin mapping is handled via a 2D array, `wifiPinStatus`, which tracks both the physical GPIO number and the current logical state (HIGH/LOW).

### GPIO Mapping

The project defines a set of pins ready for control:
- GPIO 5 (D1)
- GPIO 4 (D2)
- GPIO 0 (D3)
- GPIO 2 (D4)
- GPIO 14 (D5)
- GPIO 12 (D6)
- GPIO 13 (D7)
- GPIO 15 (D8)

## Getting Started

To use this project, developers need the Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 board support package installed. The primary sketch, `first.ino`, demonstrates the basic web server setup. 

```cpp
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <ESP8266WebServer.h>

ESP8266WebServer server(80);

void setup() {
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_AP_STA);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  connectToWifi();
  
  server.on("/", handleRoot);
  server.on("/on", handleOn);
  server.on("/off", handleOff);
  server.begin();
}
```

Users must update the `connectToWifi` function with their specific SSID and password. Once running, the ESP8266 will output its IP address to the Serial Monitor. Navigating to that IP in a web browser or sending GET requests to `/on?switch_num=1` will trigger the corresponding GPIO actions.

## SPIFFS and Advanced Usage

The inclusion of SPIFFS allows developers to separate the logic of the application from the presentation layer. Instead of embedding HTML inside the C++ code, files like `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` can be uploaded to the ESP8266's flash memory. The web server can then be configured to serve these files directly, making the development of rich user interfaces significantly easier and more maintainable.
