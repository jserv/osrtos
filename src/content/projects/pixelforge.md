title: PixelForge
summary: PixelForge is a browser-based image converter that transforms PNG and JPG
  images into Arduino-compatible C header files. It supports RGB565 and OLED bitmap
  formats for popular embedded display libraries like TFT_eSPI and U8g2, targeting
  platforms such as ESP32, STM32, and RP2040.

PixelForge serves as a specialized utility for embedded developers working with graphical displays. Converting standard image formats like PNG or JPG into the specific byte arrays required by microcontrollers can often be a tedious manual process involving external scripts or complex command-line tools. PixelForge simplifies this workflow by providing a fast, browser-based interface that runs entirely client-side.

The tool is particularly useful for developers using the ESP32, STM32, RP2040, or classic Arduino boards. It generates clean C code using the `PROGMEM` attribute, ensuring that image data is stored in flash memory rather than consuming precious RAM, which is a critical consideration in resource-constrained embedded environments.

### Conversion Capabilities

At the heart of PixelForge is a flexible conversion engine. It supports several common embedded color modes and data structures:
- **RGB565 / BGR565**: Standard 16-bit color formats used by most TFT displays.
- **OLED Bitmaps**: 1-bit (monochrome), 4-bit, and 8-bit grayscale modes.
- **Byte-Swapping**: Essential for certain display controllers that expect high and low bytes in a specific order.
- **Animation Support**: The tool can process multiple frames, auto-detecting color modes and grouping arrays for easy animation implementation in firmware.

### Live Preview and Simulation

One of the standout features is the live preview system. Before exporting code, users can see how their image will look on the target hardware. The tool includes a TFT/OLED simulation that mimics the visual characteristics of small displays, helping developers catch scaling or color issues early. For those working on dynamic interfaces, PixelForge also supports multi-frame assets, allowing for the preview and export of animations as grouped arrays.

### Integration with Embedded Libraries

The output generated by PixelForge is designed to be "plug-and-play" with the most popular graphics libraries in the Arduino ecosystem. The tool specifically targets:
- **TFT_eSPI**: Full support for RGB565 and BGR565 modes with optional byte-swapping.
- **U8g2**: Comprehensive support for 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit OLED modes.
- **Adafruit_GFX**: Support for this widely-used library is planned for future updates.

### Developer-Centric Design

The interface is built with a developer-first mindset, featuring a responsive design with GitHub-style light and dark modes. The code panel provides a large, scrollable area where users can quickly copy the generated `uint16_t` or `uint8_t` arrays. Because it runs entirely in the browser, it can be used offline and requires no installation of external software or Python dependencies to prepare assets for an embedded project.
