title: Rust Stub Library for Apache NuttX
summary: A stub library that provides the necessary build system integration and C-side
  stubs to run Rust code on the Apache NuttX RTOS. It facilitates the inclusion of
  Rust applications into the NuttX build process, targeting hardware such as ESP32
  and BL602 microcontrollers.

## Overview

The Rust Stub Library for Apache NuttX serves as a bridge between the Rust programming language and the Apache NuttX Real-Time Operating System. While Rust is increasingly popular for embedded systems due to its safety guarantees, integrating it into established RTOS build systems can be complex. This project simplifies that process by providing a "stub" structure that fits directly into the standard NuttX library architecture.

By acting as a placeholder within the `libs/` directory of the NuttX source tree, this library allows developers to link external Rust code—such as I2C drivers or test applications—into a final NuttX firmware image. It handles the necessary C-to-Rust glue and build system hooks required for a seamless compilation experience.

## Key Features

- **NuttX Build System Integration**: Includes pre-configured `Makefile` and `Kconfig` files designed to work with the standard NuttX `make menuconfig` and build process.
- **Hardware Compatibility**: Specifically tested and documented for popular embedded platforms, including the BL602 (RISC-V) and ESP32 (Xtensa) microcontrollers.
- **Modular Design**: Designed to be added as a git submodule within the `nuttx/libs` directory, keeping the core RTOS source clean while enabling Rust support.
- **I2C Support**: Demonstrates practical hardware interaction, such as talking to I2C devices from Rust code running on top of the NuttX kernel.

## Technical Implementation

The project consists of a few critical components that allow the NuttX build system to recognize Rust code as a standard library component:

1.  **Kconfig**: Defines the configuration options for the library, allowing users to enable or disable Rust support and debugging features through the NuttX configuration menu.
2.  **Makefile**: A standard NuttX-style Makefile that handles the compilation of `lib_misc.c` and manages dependencies. It ensures that the library is correctly archived into the final system binary.
3.  **lib_misc.c**: Provides the minimal C-side implementation required to satisfy the linker and provide entry points or helper functions for the Rust environment.

## Getting Started

To use this library, it must be added to an existing NuttX project as a submodule. Once placed in the `libs/librust` directory, the user must update several core NuttX build files (such as `Directories.mk` and `FlatLibs.mk`) to include the new library path. 

After updating the build configuration, users can enable the library via `make menuconfig` under the "Library Routines" section. This setup allows the developer to then point the build system to their actual Rust logic, such as the `rust-i2c-nuttx` or `rust_test` repositories, which contain the high-level application code.
