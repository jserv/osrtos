## Overview

Mbed Tools is the modern command-line interface designed to support the future of Mbed OS development. As the successor to the original Mbed CLI, this toolset provides a streamlined workflow for developers working with Mbed Enabled hardware. It focuses on core operations such as device detection, project management, and build orchestration, utilizing industry-standard tools like CMake and Ninja to provide a faster and more reliable build experience.

While the project is designed to be the primary interface for Mbed OS 6 and beyond, it maintains a focus on extensibility, providing a Python API that other tooling developers can leverage to build custom Mbed-related applications.

## Key Features

The toolset offers several critical capabilities for embedded developers:

- **Device Detection**: Automatically identifies Mbed Enabled devices connected via USB or J-Link, providing details like product codes and mount points.
- **Project Management**: Simplifies the process of checking out Mbed projects and managing library dependencies.
- **Build Orchestration**: Interfaces with CMake and Ninja to perform builds across various profiles (develop, debug, release) and toolchains.
- **Configuration System**: A robust system for managing `targets.json` and application-specific configurations, generating the necessary CMake files for the build process.

## Technical Implementation

Mbed Tools is implemented in Python and follows a modular architecture. It relies on several key technologies to deliver its functionality:

- **Build System**: It moves away from the custom build scripts of previous versions in favor of **CMake** (version 3.19.0+) and **Ninja**. This allows for better integration with modern IDEs and significantly faster incremental builds.
- **CLI Framework**: Built using the **Click** library, providing a consistent and user-friendly command-line experience with built-in help and option parsing.
- **Templating**: Uses **Jinja2** to generate build files and project metadata dynamically based on the target hardware and user configuration.
- **Hardware Interaction**: Utilizes libraries like `pyudev` (on Linux) and `pywin32` (on Windows) to interact with system-level USB and serial interfaces for device discovery.

## Getting Started

Mbed Tools is distributed via PyPI and can be installed easily within a Python virtual environment. Once installed, the `mbed-tools` command becomes available for project interaction.

### Basic Workflow

To create a new project and prepare it for a specific target, a developer might use the following sequence:

```bash
# Create a new project
mbed-tools new my-project

# Detect connected devices
mbed-tools detect

# Configure the build for a specific target and toolchain
mbed-tools configure -m K64F -t GCC_ARM

# Compile the project
mbed-tools compile -m K64F -t GCC_ARM
```

## Ecosystem and Compatibility

The project is deeply integrated into the Mbed OS ecosystem. It parses `targets.json` from the Mbed OS source tree to understand hardware capabilities, memory maps, and toolchain requirements. By generating `mbed_config.cmake`, it bridges the gap between Mbed's complex configuration system and the standard CMake build process. This allows developers to use standard C++ development tools while still benefiting from the hardware abstraction and RTOS features provided by Mbed OS.
