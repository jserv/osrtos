### Features

- QuarkTS uses a cooperative Round-Robin scheme with a linked chain approach, and a queue to provide true FIFO priority-scheduling. 
- QuarkTS uses a Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA), in which the tasks are triggered by comparing the corresponding task-time with a monotonic real-time clock.
