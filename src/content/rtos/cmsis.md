summary: CMSIS is a set of tools, APIs, frameworks, and workflows designed to simplify
  software re-use, reduce the learning curve for microcontroller developers, and accelerate
  project build and debug processes. It was initiated as a vendor-independent hardware
  abstraction layer for Arm® Cortex®-M based processors and later expanded to support
  entry-level Arm Cortex-A based processors. CMSIS aims to provide a consistent approach
  to interface with peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components.
