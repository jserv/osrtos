title: modm
slug: modm
summary: modm is a modular C++23 library generator and hardware abstraction layer
  (HAL) designed for resource-constrained AVR and ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. It
  utilizes the lbuild code generator to produce target-specific startup code, drivers,
  and communication protocols with a focus on zero memory allocation and high portability
  across thousands of devices.

### Architecture

modm follows a modular, data-driven architectural pattern centered around the **lbuild** code generator. Unlike traditional static libraries, modm generates a custom library instance tailored specifically to the target microcontroller and project requirements. The architecture is layered to provide maximum portability while maintaining hardware-specific optimizations. At the lowest level, the library generates startup code and a Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) that provides a unified C++23 interface for peripherals like GPIO, UART, and SPI across different vendors.

Above the HAL, modm provides target-independent drivers for external components (sensors, displays, etc.) and high-level communication protocols. A key architectural principle is the avoidance of dynamic memory allocation within the HAL, ensuring predictable RAM consumption. The system also includes a cooperative multitasking layer based on stackful fibers, allowing for complex asynchronous logic without the overhead of a full preemptive RTOS, though integration with FreeRTOS is provided for more demanding applications.

### Use Cases

This library is ideal for:

- **Autonomous Robotics**: Specifically optimized for high-reliability requirements in competitions like Eurobot where predictable program flow is critical.
- **Resource-Constrained Devices**: Ideal for 8-bit AVR and small ARM Cortex-M0+ devices where low RAM and flash consumption are paramount.
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Projects that need to maintain a single codebase across different microcontroller families (e.g., STM32 and SAM).
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Developers using supported development boards (Nucleo, Discovery, Arduino) who need a high-level C++ API without sacrificing performance.
- **Industrial Communication**: Applications requiring robust CAN, CAN-FD, or Ethernet stacks with integrated third-party networking libraries.
- **Embedded GUI Development**: Systems requiring graphical interfaces via LVGL integration on various display controllers.

### Getting Started

To begin using modm, developers must clone the repository recursively to include all necessary submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/modm-io/modm.git`. The library relies on the **lbuild** tool to generate the specific library files for your target; this process involves creating a project configuration file that specifies the microcontroller and required modules. 

Comprehensive documentation, including installation guides for the required toolchains and a detailed "Discover" guide, is available at [modm.io](http://modm.io). The repository also contains hundreds of up-to-date examples for various architectures and development boards, which serve as the primary reference for implementing peripheral drivers and third-party integrations.
