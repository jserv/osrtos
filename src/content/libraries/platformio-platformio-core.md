title: platformio-core
summary: PlatformIO Core is a cross-platform, multi-architecture build system and
  unified package manager designed for embedded systems development. It provides a
  command-line interface that orchestrates toolchains, library dependencies, and build
  processes across hundreds of boards and dozens of frameworks, eliminating vendor
  lock-in.

- Support for multiple architectures including ARM, AVR, RISC-V, and FPGA.



PlatformIO Core is built on a decentralized, modular architecture implemented in Python. It functions as an orchestration layer that abstracts the complexities of different hardware platforms and software development kits (SDKs). The system relies on a declarative configuration model where the `platformio.ini` file defines the project environment, including boards, frameworks, and library dependencies. This configuration triggers the Core to dynamically fetch required toolchains and libraries from the PlatformIO Registry, ensuring a reproducible build environment across different developer machines.

**Core Components**
* **Build System**: A SCons-based engine that handles compilation, linking, and firmware image generation across diverse toolchains.
* **Package Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of development platforms, toolchains, and libraries, handling versioning and updates.
* **Library Dependency Finder (LDF)**: Analyzes source code to identify and include necessary libraries automatically, resolving complex dependency trees.
* **Unified Debugger**: A standardized interface for GDB-based debugging that works across various hardware probes and microcontrollers without manual configuration.

### Use Cases

This library is ideal for:
- **Cross-Platform Development**: Managing embedded projects that need to be compiled for multiple different microcontrollers (e.g., AVR and ESP32) using a single codebase and configuration.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Integrating embedded firmware builds and unit tests into automated pipelines like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to ensure code quality.
- **Library Management**: Simplifying the process of finding, installing, and updating third-party libraries without manual file management or vendor-specific IDEs.
- **Professional Embedded Engineering**: Developing commercial-ready products by leveraging modern toolchains, static analysis, and unit testing methodologies.

### Getting Started

To get started with PlatformIO Core, you can install it via Python's package manager using `pip install platformio`. Once installed, you can initialize a new project by running `pio project init --board <board_id>` in your terminal, which generates the essential directory structure and the `platformio.ini` configuration file. For detailed guidance on commands and configuration, refer to the official [PlatformIO Core Documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html) and the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/quickstart.html).
